The bail hearing of three men who face a number of charges including murder, attempted murder and robbery was postponed again at the Mthatha magistrateâ€™s court on Friday. Siphiwo Nyangani, 27, Olwethu Tuswa, 28, and Vusumzi Zazaza, 27, were arrested last week Thursday and are suspected to be behind a string of business robberies targeting shops owned by foreign nationals. The matter was postponed to Tuesday.
