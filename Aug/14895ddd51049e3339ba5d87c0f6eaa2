Andrew Turnbull was on Wednesday granted R5 000 bail in an emergency bail application heard at the Randburg magistrateâ€™s court. Turnbull will appear before the magistrate again on October 30. Former East Londoner Turnbull was arrested in Johannesburg last week Tuesday on drug charges, this was soon after a video of him holding a woman in a choke-hold and tossing her aside was widely circulated on social media. On Thursday last week his bail application had been postponed to what should have been a week later.
