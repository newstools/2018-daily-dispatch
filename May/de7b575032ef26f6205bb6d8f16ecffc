A 34-YEAR-OLD East London man who had an affair with murder accused Bulelwa Ndudula, 46, yesterday told a judge she threatened to shoot him dead in 2016 because he was ignoring her phone calls. Department of health data capturer, Ayanda Tuswa, who is a qualified electrician and did freelance electrical work, yesterday told the East London High Court Judge Belinda Hartle that he had a week-long affair with Ndudula in 2009. He said they had the affair when they were both working as elections officers for the Independent Electoral Commission during the election period of that year. Tuswa said he abruptly ended the affair after a week because he was “uncomfortable” with sneaking out of his home where he lived with his parents in Cambridge every night, to spend the night with her. It was a strain to sneak back to his home in the early hours of the morning and then still have to work. Tuswa said he decided to end the relationship in 2009, without even informing Ndudula, because he was also embarrassed by their 12-year age difference. The week-long trial which commenced on Monday, continues tomorrow morning.
