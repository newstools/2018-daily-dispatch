Police and members of the Foreman Road informal settlement clashed on Wednesday morning‚ a day after shack dweller Ndumiso Mnguni was shot during anti-land invasion operations. Public Order Police used rubber bullets and teargas to disperse a crowd that had blocked Clare Road‚ a main arterial route through the Durban suburb. Police had reportedly come under attack by the mob‚ hurling stones at officers from beyond burning barricades.
Officers hit back with a water cannon‚ the jets of blue laced with pepper spray. Officers had by mid-morning pushed the group back into the informal settlement. This comes in the wake of the killing of S’fiso Ngcobo‚ chair of the body in eKukhayeni‚ who was shot and killed outside his home near Mariannhill. Abahlali baseMjondolo spokesman Sbu Zikode said on Wednesday morning that a group of unknown men descended on his house and opened fire.
