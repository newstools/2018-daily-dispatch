Former ANC Youth League leader in Buffalo City has been arrested by police for allegedly raping and assaulting a prostitute. The man, in his 30s, who cannot be named as he’s yet to appear in court, was arrested over the weekend by East London police. Apparently he took a prostitute in the East London beachfront and went to a secluded place but an argument ensued between the two as the prostitute refused to entertain the man “in the open”. A police source said the man allegedly assaulted and raped her. “The woman managed to flee and she later flagged down a patrolling police vehicle…the police later returned to the scene and found the suspect, this time, with another prostitute. He was arrested on the spot,” said the source. He spent the weekend at Fleet Street police station holding cells and is expected to appear today at the East London Magistrate’s Court.
