Thirty–year-old Banele Mancoba and his younger sibling Ephraim, 23, who are part of controversial “Seven Angels” briefly appeared in the Ngcobo Magistrate’s Court  alongside their 10 co-accused on charges of conspiracy to commit robbery with aggravating circumstances. The other suspects are Siphenathi Mafikwana, Nyameko Gemi, Anelani  Nobetha, Luxolo Sixolo, Thulani Mrwetyana, Lwandiso Phosa, Zuko Makhephula, Loyiso Buhlungu, Mawande Jijingubo and Zukile Nkanunu. However the case was postponed to June 25 after the state prosecutor Sikhona Ndika told magistrate Thobile Bara that police investigations into their case were not yet completed. The 12 suspects are accused of conspiring to rob a fuel depot in Ngcobo late last year. Banele also appeared before Bara on another charge of rape but was told that the case would also be postponed to June 25 as well. The two Mancobas gained infamy earlier this year after police raided their controversial Angels Ministry Church in Nyanga village following the ruthless killing of five police members and an off-duty police member. Three of the so-called Seven Angels, Thandazile, Xolisa and Philile were killed following a gunbattle with the police which saw seven people dead. Meanwhile Phuthumile and five other church members were subsequently charged with the murders of the five police members.
