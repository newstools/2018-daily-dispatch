Bonang is like super saine 100 when it comes to blocking out hate but occasionally she just has to grab her phone and let a person know their place in life. It all started when a hater hijacked a conversation between B and a fan asking how old she was. When the troll heard that B was a whole 30‚ the person asked her what she was doing with her life besides going for “guy after guy and not having any babies”. 30 but No BABY what the fuck are you doing with your life guy after guy come on man — Welcome (@Welcome08797557) May 20, 2018  We were on some…  The B Force strapped up their boots and grabbed their data bundles to defend their queen. @bonang_m just say a word re tla mo sort'a out… nxla H.D.O sies High school Drop Out pic.twitter.com/WDjsL5DBZ4 — ThatoM (@moh_jovial) May 20, 2018  Yaz wavele wangiqeda mandla.

Making money.  https://t.co/7gOSV8V6Ac — Bonang B* Matheba (@bonang_m) May 20, 2018  Knowing B‚ she then blocked the troll faster than DMF’S Raymond being blue ticked by slay queens. But Queen B has spoken about the whole babies and man thing before. She responded to a similar tweet late last year‚ telling fans: “We have different priorities‚” and “Dear Male‚ you’re trying to tell me what I want/need. Please stop.” Bonang also told TshisaLIVE in a previous interview that she was currently focused on her reality show‚ being happy and getting her coins. “It’s not about doing what’s popular anymore. It is about paying things forward and doing things that are right for me‚” she added.
