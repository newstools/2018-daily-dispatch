Beachgoers have been cautioned by BCM to stay away from the Gonubie Beach after what was described as a “massive shark” was spotted by lifeguards. “The beach will be closed for today as per shark sighting policy, we urge people to adhere accordingly,” read a statement on the municipality’s Facebook page. Glenn Hollands, an East London surfer, however said that the alert was a result of a mix–up. Hollands explained that while he was surfing at Gonubie Reef he noticed a swirl of water form around him while sitting at the break. He said that this was unusual and made it appear as if there was a predator hunting in the area. A fellow surfer shouted that there was a shark and the two quickly paddled to shore. Once there they informed the lifeguards who raised the shark warning. Hollands said that they were later told by surfers who were further out that what appeared to be a shark was in fact a couple of dolphins, which are “not usually in that area” due to dirty river mouth water, acting strangely while hunting in a group. Despite this Allen Zealand, BCM recreation manager, said that lifeguards had not told him about dolphins and that it was best to remain cautious.
