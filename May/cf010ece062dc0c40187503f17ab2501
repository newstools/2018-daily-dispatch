Transport, Safety and Liaison MEC, Weziwe Tikana this morning held an emergency media briefing to address the latest public violence in Mthatha. The march was allegedly led by members of the South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) however in a written statement they have distanced themselves. 
The impasse is over the closed taxi ranks. Tikana this morning said the march was unlawful and that other ranks will open but only after a thorough verification of who will operate from where.
