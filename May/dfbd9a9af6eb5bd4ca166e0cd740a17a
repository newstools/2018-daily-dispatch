By ZINGISA MVUMVU and SIMTHANDILE FORD There’s a new uncle Gweezy in town. In case you were wondering what ever happened to minister of minerals Gwede Mantashe’s oversize suits, well the old man has undergone a makeover to avoid election defeat for the ruling party because of his big suits. The former ANC secretary-general did not only secure a new job but also a brand new wardrobe by the look of things. Mantashe has become a social media sensation in a video that is doing the rounds where he explains his new look. In the video, which also features the melodramatic and stylish Fikile “Razzmatazz” Mbalula, Mantashe attempts to explain his new wardrobe and calls for social media users to remove his old pictures where he had become used as a meme for wearing oversize suits. Mantashe says it had made him a laughing stock to former president Jacob Zuma and it was going to lead to the ANC’s election defeat next year. “I used to wonder why Zuma used to laugh so hard when I appeared. Now I realise it was these oversize suits,” Mantashe joked. “Take those pictures of oversized suits off from social media …my image is changing… move with the times we were going to lose elections with those (oversized) suits.” Perhaps Mantashe can improve the ANC’s election victory chances by also joining in on president Cyril Ramaphosa’s early morning “Thuma Mina” walks to address his big tummy problems which are surely a turn off to potential ANC voters, especially the born-frees.
