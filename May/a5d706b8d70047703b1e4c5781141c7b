An Eastern Cape municipal official was rushed to hospital on Thursday night after suffering an asthma attack during a service delivery protest. This was after a member of an angry group of protesters which entered the Lusikisiki offices of the Ingquza Hill municipality, opened the nozzle of a fire extinguisher and let rip with high-pressure foam aimed at municipal manager Mluleki Fihlani in a bid to flush him out. Fihlani confirmed the incident, saying an asthmatic Thandokazi Pangwa, a 32-year-old translation officer, was caught in the crossfire. “We were busy preparing for the state of the municipal address and the officer was busy helping us in translating the speech when the group of protesters banged [down] the door, and made their way into the building,” said Fihlani. “Criminal elements had crept in and were using a fire extinguisher to get our attention. “I had to see a doctor this morning, because I have chest pains. What is even worse is that the leaders of the protest were not even looking for me, but the Cogta MEC Fikile Xasa and ANC provincial leaders,” said Fihlani. The protesters, led by truck drivers, contractors and members of the business chamber, demanded to see the mayor Jongintaba Mdingi, as well as ANC chairman Oscar Mabuyane and provincial secretary Lulama Ngcukayitobi. The group had been talking to the municipality for over a year, to see how local businesses could benefit in major contracts in which the municipality is involved. “I had to explain to them that Treasury guidelines view ‘local’ as any company from South Africa and if this needs to be localised even further, national treasury would have to give a go-ahead,” said Fihlani. All offices were closed yesterday, and the state of the municipality address (Soma), scheduled for yesterday, has been postponed. “[The] Cogta MEC has committed to come and address the issues at 11am on Saturday [today],” Fihlani confirmed.
