North West premier Supra Mahumapelo says he is taking early retirement from his post. This comes after he met with national ANC leadership earlier this week. His “retirement” comes after a protracted political battle with his detractors in the province. This is the second time Mahumapelo announces his departure from the post after national government intervention in the province.
