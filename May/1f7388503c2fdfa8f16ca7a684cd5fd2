Disgruntled Buffalo Flats  extension residents which consists of Fynbos, Egoli and Vergenoeg have closed the Mdantsane Access road ‘Black road’ this morning with burning tyres to voice their grievances over housing allocation in the areas.  The protests started on Wednesday night when Vergenoeg community members flocked outside BCM Ward 10 councillor Roseline Witbooi’s house demanding answers related to the allocation of the RDP houses that are being built in the area. Angry residents of Fynbos closed  the Dunoon road that gives access to  Empilweni Clinic in Gompo over allegations that ward councillor Ayanda Mapisa used racial slurs when asked about the allocation process. “She said coloureds will not receive any houses as long as she is still a councillor. Today is our day to speak out, we have been patience for too long,” said community leader Lawrence Petersen. Daily Dispatch’s calls to Mapisa and Witbooi were unanswered.
