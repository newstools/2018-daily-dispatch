A 20-year–old Mdantsane sedan taxi (Iphela) driver Sibongile Mtyobisi, and his 19-year–old co-accused Asemahle Nyakumbi, were this week denied bail by the East London bail court.  The pair were arrested late last month for kidnapping, raping, stabbing nine times and robbing a 34-year–old female passenger who had taken the taxi from East London CBD to Scenery Park. It is the state’s case that the two were travelling in Mtyobisi’s taxi, together with another man, known only as Mzimkhulu who is still on the run, and two female accomplices who are now state witnesses, when they picked up the Shoprite employee in town on her way to Scenery Park. They later drove to a secluded bushy area near Amalinda where Nyakumbi and Mzimkhulu stabbed the woman numerous times before raping and robbing her of her belongings.
