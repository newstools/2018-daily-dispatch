DA’s senior Eastern Cape leader Veliswa Mvenya resigned from the party this morning. She is the third senior party member to resign from the Bobby Stevenson-led Bhisho legislature caucus. First to go, as allegations that the party was fast becoming anti-black, was Nokonwaba Matikinca in 2015. On Tuesday former Eastern Cape Premier Nosimo Balindlela announced she was also leaving the “blue wave” for the ANC, her initial political home.
Mvenya this morning confirmed submitting her resignation letter, saying: “She has resigned to take a break from politics.”
