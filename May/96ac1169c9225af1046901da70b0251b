In an attempt to bring about stability at the troubled St Elizabeth Hospital in Lusikisiki, superintendent-general, Tobile Mbengashe today led a team of managers to look at issues affecting the hospital. Operations were disrupted two weeks ago after staff, including all nurses downed tools demanding the removal of the hospital CEO Mzingisi Tshaka. They had accused him among other things of nepotism. Department of health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo the purpose of the visit by the SG and his team was to meet with the labour unions and give them a report on the progress of their investigation. Kupelo said preliminary report which has cleared him on allegations of nepotism has been discussed during different meetings with the board, labour and management. “The CEO remains on special leave but the department will continue to engage stakeholders,” he said. Nehawu chairman at the hospital Nkosinathi Mkhumbuzi said other issues they were not happy about with the CEO that he did not want to recognise them. Kupelo said the SG would now report back to the health MEC Helen-Sauls August about the visit. “Labour unions requested time to consult with mass members on the report,” he said. Mkhumbuzi told the Dispatch yesterday that workers have made it clear that regardless of what the outcomes were, they did not want the CEO back. “Workers took a decision that  immediately Mr Tshaka returns to the hospital, they will all go out and return the day he left,” he said.
