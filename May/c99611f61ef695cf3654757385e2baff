If a picture circulating on social media is anything to go by‚ the abducted Katlego Marite was given a hero’s welcome when he returned home on Thursday.  The 12-year-old was snatched in broad daylight just metres away from his house on Sunday while he walked back home with his friends. In the image shared on Twitter‚ Katlego is dressed in red shorts‚ a baseball jacket and sandals and he is seen standing on a ledge outside his home in Tasbet Park‚ Witbank.  The driveway to the house‚ which is a grand mansion nicknamed Nkandla by community members‚ was visited by scores of community members who gathered around Katlego‚ snapping pictures and smiling at him. Katlego himself is seen smiling at the crowd. His sister Masego‚ who celebrates her birthday on Friday (today) is seen standing behind him‚ her hands raised to her face in apparent jubilation. While police has refused to divulge how and where Katlego was found‚ TimesLIVE has learnt that he was dropped off by his kidnappers in Kromdraai near Witbank on Thursday. His kidnappers had demanded a ransom of about R1.5-million in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Earlier this week‚ the family told TimesLIVE they were distraught because they had no idea what Bitcoins were. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi refused to indicate whether or not the family had paid the ransom‚ saying this would form part of the investigation. It is understood that no arrests have been made in connection with the crime.
