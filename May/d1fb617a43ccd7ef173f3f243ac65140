A hostage drama in Evengreen Circle‚ Phoenix‚ has drawn to a close after a lone gunman handed himself over to police on Thursday morning.  KZN VIP Security spokesman Glen Naidoo said that a shooting had preceded the stand-off‚ with medics called to a house in Ironbridge Place shortly before sunrise. “A woman had been shot by a man‚ believed to be an ex-boyfriend‚ who fled the scene in a bakkie. The woman was treated by paramedics at the scene and then rushed to hospital‚” he said. Naidoo said that the gunman then holed himself up in a flat in Evergreen Circle‚ where he made his stand. “He was armed with a pistol and threatened other people and also threatened to take his own life. We were called out again and we called for the assistance of the police‚” Naidoo added. He said that a specialised hostage negotiator‚ backed by members of the elite police Special Task Force‚ had reasoned with the man‚ who eventually relinquished his weapon and handed himself over. “The drama just all came to an end and the guy handed over his gun without a shot being fired‚” he said. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said that the man was arrested and will appear in court once he has been charged.
