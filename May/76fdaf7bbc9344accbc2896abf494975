An East London businessman has spoken out about his ordeal with armed robbers who invaded his Bunkers Hill home on April 5, kidnapped him and his two cousins and stole R100 000 from his bank account. Eritrean national Mussie Kahase Aizaya told the Dispatch he was too afraid to return to his business premises and he had tightened security at his Bunker’s Hill home. Aizaya said he spent 12 dreadful hours with his kidnappers, who released him near Stutterheim. Cambridge police spokesman Mluleki Mbi confirmed at the time of the attack that R40 000 was withdrawn from Aizaya’s account by the criminals from eight different ATMs. A further R60 000 was paid as ransom by Aizaya’s Durbanbased brother.
