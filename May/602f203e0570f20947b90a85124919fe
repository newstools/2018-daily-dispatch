Johannesburg Metro Police Department spokesman Waybe Minnaar told TimesLIVE shortly after 9pm on Wednesday that the man suffered minor injuries and was rushed to hospital. “Suspects shot at [a CIT] van on N3 south at Marlboro‚ but sped off. Driver of the van was slightly injured and taken to hospital. “The traffic lanes have been blocked off for the scene to be investigated‚” he said.

Two of the men were traveling in the cash-in-transit van and two more men were in a security vehicle when shots were fired at them‚” said Siddall.
