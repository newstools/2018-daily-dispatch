Academic activities at the Walter Sisulu University’s Mthatha campus have ground to a halt as students demand the removal of a security company they accuse of victimizing them. On Sunday a fight broke out between students and Fidelity security guards. This comes after two students were admitted to Mthatha Regional Hospital with injuries they sustained after being allegedly assaulted by the security guards at Nelson Mandela Drive and Zamukulungisa learning sites. Sasco provincial task team member and student and the NMD Kanya Kenqa said it was not true that they were working with drug lords to smuggle drugs to the university. “It was students who have been calling for raids and seizure of weapons and drugs. The narrative that we are working with drug lords to bring drugs on campus is far from the truth,” he said. Kenqa said the security guards at the both Zamakulungisa and Nelson Mandela Drive sites were using guerilla tactics to harass and victimise students. “Their main task is to students and maintain peace on the campus, but they are doing the opposite of that,” he said. University spokeswoman Yonela Tukwayo told DispatchLive earlier that the reason students wanted Fidelity security guards out of the campus was because they were stopping smuggling of drugs to the university. She said with the recent raids on campus, they obviously stepped on the territory of powerful individuals who are seemingly powerful in the criminal world. She said the management were still standing their ground because they knew that there were going to be unhappy people, ” when we bust drug trafficking that is happening on the campus and through our other campuses,” she said. Students are scheduled to have a mass meeting this afternoon to discus a way forward.
