Buffalo City Metro yesterday revealed its newly renovated state-of-the-art Intelligence Operations Centre, valued at R600 000, at the launch of its new integrated website yesterday afternoon.  Twelve massive plasma screens feed live data from more than 35 surveillance cameras placed around the city, and there are streams of smart metre readings and information on households owing revenue. The new centre is the office of three graduates from BCM’s ICT programme, which saw 25 young men and women complete a one-year course. The three will communicate with customers who lodge complaints through the new website or the BCM app and then forward them to the relevant departments. Mayor Xola Pakati said he was excited about the new technology they were using to honour their promise of being a smart city. “The website is one of the undertakings that was made during the “State of the Metro Address” last year and is part of the citizen engagement platform, a platform we want to use to encourage transparency and immediate communication.” BCM spokesman Samkelo Ngwenya said the new website’s homepage indicated the number of vacancies and tender opportunities available, which they hoped would go some way towards alleviating the high unemployment rate in the metro. “Our camera surveillance allows us to track the number plates of vehicles, and there is a facial recognition element which allows us to minimise crime. We can also zoom in on many of our streets to see the potholes, so we can get them fixed promptly, among other amazing features,” said BCM ICT manager Jongikhaya Stuurman. The new website is responsive and adaptive to different platforms, including mobile and desktop. “This will enable users to navigate easily and enable them to access emergency contact numbers for reporting service delivery challenges. Electricity can be bought and BCM payments can also be made on the website,” Stuurman said. “The website is not restricted to those with smartphones.”
