A band of 10 alleged soccer hooligans appeared together for the first time in the Durban Magistrate’s Court. The group were arrested one after the other as a police dragnet tightened. They face charges of public violence relating to a wave of violence that erupted at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on April 21 after Kaizer Chiefs lost to Free State Stars. Phelelani Jojisa‚ Sihle Zungu‚ Zibongile Njova‚ Nolwethu Sokotha‚ Lungisani Jaca‚ Douglas Mkhize‚ Cebolendoda Hadebe‚ Khwezilomo Madiba‚ John Khumalo and Siphosenkosi Memela lined up in the dock. Madiba is understood to have been caught on camera kicking a security guard in the face‚ while Memela and Khumalo are alleged to have been sighted tampering with camera equipment. All have been barred from attending any sporting fixture or recreational gathering until the finalisation of the court case. The matter will be referred to the Regional Court for trial and all of the alleged pitch invaders are out on bail. They are due back in court on June 26. Police and stadium security were overrun as fans invaded the pitch at the end of the game‚ heading directly for embattled Chiefs coach Steve Komphela‚ who quit immediately after the game. The pandemonium left many people injured and property damaged. The damage to the stadium and technical equipment belonging to broadcasters is said to have amounted to millions‚ with some equipment pilfered. Two vehicles parked at the back of the stadium were also damaged. Police released a gallery of mugshots of individuals they had identified as having contributed to the bedlam.
