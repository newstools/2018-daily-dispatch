Breidbach Secondary School teacher Lubabalo Qoboshiyana is fighting for her life in East London’s Life St Dominic’s Hospital after a car accident yesterday morning.  The newly qualified teacher, 23, is the daughter of Cricket South Africa independent national selector Luxolo Qoboshiyana. He said his daughter was going to work yesterday morning when the accident happened between Bhisho and Zwelitsha. “She was driving towards Zwelitsha from the Bhisho direction. “A car from King William’s Town did not stop at the stop [sign] and drove into her car. “Her car rolled four times before it came to a stop on the side of the road,” he said. Luxolo said his daughter was in pain and crying when she was taken from the scene of the accident. “She was airlifted to Life St Dominic’s Hospital. It was really painful to see my daughter and her mother crying like that,” he said. He added that his daughter had introduced him to her friends when they were watching rugby at the Dale College reunion at the weekend. King William’s Town police spokeswoman Captain Siphokazi Mawisa confirmed the accident, saying it happened just after 8am. Mawisa said one driver was taken to hospital while the other escaped with no injuries. “A case of reckless and negligent driving was registered for investigation,” she said. — zolilem@tisoblackstar.co.za
