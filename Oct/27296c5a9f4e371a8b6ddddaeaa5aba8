Buffalo City Metro workers have downed tools and are gathering at the North End stadium before marching to the East London City Hall. The workers say they will hand over a memorandum of demands to mayor Xola Pakati. Their grievances and demands include a call for the metro to conduct a job evaluation process, hire temporary workers and stop outsourcing work to independent companies. The workers are singing anti-city manager Andile Sihlahla songs calling him a dog.
