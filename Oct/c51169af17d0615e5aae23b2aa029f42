Convicted fraudster and race-rant accused Kessie Nair is expected to launch a fresh bid for bail - and wants magistrate Ncumisa Gcolotela to recuse herself. Attorney Chris Gounden‚ for Nair‚ told the Verulam Magistrate’s Court that they were poised to bring another bail application based “on new facts”. Furthermore‚ they would apply to have Gcolotela recuse herself so the application can be heard by another magistrate. Nair faces multiple charges of crimen injuria and incitement to commit violence after calling President Cyril Ramaphosa the k-word in a Facebook video he posted. The nephew of late struggle stalwart Billy Nair‚ who served several years after he was convicted on fraud charges‚ has received widespread condemnation from various quarters‚ including the provincial ANC‚ community and religious organisations‚ as well as the presidency. Last week Gcolotela denied Nair’s bail application. In delivering her ruling she accused him of using the dock as a soapbox from which to further defame a long list of people. “He attacked the characters of so many people in his affidavit. He insulted the investigating officer‚ who he referred to as being insane‚ a lunatic and a sangoma. He refers to the senior prosecutor as being corrupt and he attacked the integrity of the senior magistrate and so many others‚” she said. “He used this platform to continue where he left off when he published defamatory remarks by using the journalists who were present‚” added Gcolotela. The matter was adjourned so that Gounden could furnish the state with his new facts in the case. Nair will appear in court again on October 30.
