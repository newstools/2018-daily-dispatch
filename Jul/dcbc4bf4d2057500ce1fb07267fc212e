Joao Rodrigues‚ the apartheid policeman implicated in the murder of slain activist Ahmed Timol‚ was brought before court on Monday to face murder charges. He appeared in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Monday morning. It emerged on Sunday that Rodrigues had been issued with a warrant of arrest. Last year‚ the High Court in Pretoria ruled that Timol did not commit suicide‚ as concluded by apartheid-era investigations. Eighty-year-old Rodrigues last year gave evidence in an inquest into Timol's death in the Pretoria High Court‚ which replaced the 1972 suicide finding with one of murder. Rodrigues was a member of the security branch and is the last known person to have seen Timol alive before the 29-year-old activist allegedly fell to his death from a 10th floor window at John Vorster Square (now known as Johannesburg central police station) in 1971.
