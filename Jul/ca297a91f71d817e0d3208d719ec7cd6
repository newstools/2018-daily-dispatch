If you fancy meeting the Daily Dispatch team over a cup of coffee, then join us this weekend. On Sunday, journalists and managers will hear what you think of our new design. We will be at the Vincent Park food court outside Mugg & Bean, Amalinda SuperSpar and Mdantsaneâ€™s NU13 SuperSpar. The sessions will run from 10am until noon. The first 200 participants to arrive at the Vincent Park session will each get a free cup of coffee. One lucky reader also stands a chance to win a DStv Explora decoder.
