Walking 18km a day to Gasela High is wearing out Grade 12 pupil Luvuno Maseti’s shoes. The 18-year-old said the long trudge from Tolofiyeni location to school and back has forced him to change his school shoes many times.  About 150 disgruntled parents and pupils from Gasela High in Mxhoxha near King William’s Town closed the school gates yesterday after they were told pupils would not receive government-funded scholar transport. They said they had been promised scholar transport since 2014. However, on Thursday, the school was told there would be no buses coming for them. Instead transport will be given to pupils who go to Zukhanye High School, which is 14 km from the location. Enraged parents and pupils protested next to the school gates, demanding the state help them with transport. Parent Nomelikhaya Bangisa said the decision shocked them because last year they were told that Gasela High school was first on the department’s budget list for scholar transport. “My biggest worry is Grade 12 pupils who have to walk all this distance,” said Bangisa. The Dispatch spoke to about 30 parents in the group of about 150 protesters. They said transport costs R350 a month while for pupils from Tolofiyeni the cost is R400 monthly. “I have two kids in this school, some parents have five. How do you expect me to pay for this,” asked an aggrieved Bangisa. SGB member Nomzamo Kantini said education officials only informed the board about the decision not to provide scholar transport for the school on Thursday. “Since 2014 they have been promising us transport. “Now they come up with this,” said Kantini. Provincial education spokesperson Malibongwe Mtima said he could not comment as he was waiting to get information. Maseti said: “We won’t stop until our demands are met. “We have been waiting for this for many years. “We can’t just stop caring and act normal when things aren’t right.” The principal, Kwadwo Appiah-Danquah, declined to comment. — mandilakhek@dispatch.co.za
