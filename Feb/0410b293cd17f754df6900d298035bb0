The Hemingways Cinema in East London will not show the premier of the controversial circumcision movie Inxeba (The Wound) which was set to hit the big screens countrywide today. This comes in light of a march organised by Eastern Cape traditional leaders to disrupt the movie premiere at 10am today over perceived cultural insensitivity.. The march would start at the corner of Vincent Road and Western Avenue and go all the way up to the Hemingways Mall. In their official Facebook page this morning, Hemingways Shopping Mall management said: “Dear Shopper. We have just received word from Tsogo Sun that the movie ‘Inxeba – The Wound’ showing has been suspended, and will not be running today as previously advertised. Kind regards, Centre Management.”
