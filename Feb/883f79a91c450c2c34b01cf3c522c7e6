The ANC top six were forced to cancel a trip to Cape Town yesterday as pressure mounts on the ruling party to settle the matter of Jacob Zuma’s presidency.  The party’s top officials, led by ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa, instead held a meeting at Luthuli House to discuss Zuma’s fate. The Saturday Dispatch understands that Ramaphosa and his close allies have been losing public sympathy due to the snail’s pace at which the matter is being dealt with. Zuma has failed to keep his word of signing his resignation letter and is reportedly demanding that his legal fees be paid before he signs on the dotted line. Ramaphosa gave his top five officials a run-down of developments since the Tuesday meeting, which resulted in the shelving of the State of the Nation Address. A senior ANC official yesterday told the Saturday Dispatch: “Cyril had hoped to prepare a dignified exit for JZ, but he is not assisting … He has to resign. If not on Saturday, it has to be Sunday. Comrades have had enough.”
