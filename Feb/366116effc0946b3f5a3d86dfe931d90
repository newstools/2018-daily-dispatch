“As things stand, Premier (Phumulo) Masualle will deliver the State of the Province address,” ANC provincial secretary Lulama Ngcukayitobi said today. This as the province awaits clarity on whether the ANC in the Eastern Cape would recall Masualle as Premier and replace him with ANC chairman Oscar Mabuyane. Mabuyane was sworn in as a member of the legislature on Monday along with his deputy Mlungisi Mvoko, an indication that the cabinet would be changed. But Ngcukayitobi said because they are still awaiting for “feedback” from the ANC national officials, and that the tabling of Sopa is the sole responsibility of legislature Speaker Noxolo Kiviet and not the ANC, “as far as things stand today (Wednesday), there will be no change of leadership before the State of the Province address. “We are expecting exhaustive engagement from the national officials and it should be soon. We decided to give them enough time because there are pressing issues at national level. When the dust settles at national, they will be able to attend to our issues,” said Ngcukayitobi.
