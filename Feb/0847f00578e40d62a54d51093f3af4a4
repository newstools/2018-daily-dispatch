 An auction sale of one of the two houses belonging to the late ANC Youth League leader Sive Nombembe, a businessman at the centre of Mnquma Municipality’s R10-million black refuse bags scandal, was today halted at an 11th-hour after his widow approached court to halt such sale, apparently telling the court that the house belonged to her as Nombembe had bought it for her. This despite the house being registered under Nombembe’s name. This was confirmed today by Kenneth O’Connor of O’Connor Auctioneers and Appraisers, an East London company contracted to oversee the placing under the hammer of such properties. O’Connor told the Dispatch that the sale of one of the houses was halted as a result of a notice of motion apparently filed in court by Nombembe’s wife. She could not be contacted at the time of writing today. O’Connor however refused to give more details on the matter and instead referred more queries to the estate curator Mike Timkoe who also refused to comment, saying the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDDP) was best suited to comment on the matter. However spokesman Advocate Mthunzi Mhaga also could not be reached. Nombembe’s two houses in the affluent Extension 6 suburb in Butterworth, worth a combined R1.6-million, were both set to go under the hammer today after they were attached during the NDDP investigation into the Mnquma scandal. One of the houses, a seven-bedroom house, three outside rooms and a rundown swimming pool, among other features, which Nombembe bought in 2016 at a cost of just over R640 000, according to O’Connor, fetched more than double its price when it was auctioned for R1.3-million.
