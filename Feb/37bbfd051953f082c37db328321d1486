Police are this evening monitoring the situation at two Walter Sisulu University learning sites at the Mthatha campus after violence between two rival student organizations erupted. SRC president Mxolisi Zoko has confirmed the incident, but said the situation was under control. The fight between Pasma and ANCYL started at the Nelson Mandela Drive site and carried on to Zamukulungisa site. Students from both sites were gathered at the NMD site auditorium where a mass meeting was scheduled to take place. It is still not clear how the fight started. Police were  called and they escorted a group of students from Zamukulungisa to their learning site. A student who requested to remain anonymous for the fear of being target said, it was hardly five minutes after they arrived at Zamukulungisa site. “The rivalry group arrived and started attacking them,” he said. Police and the university spokeswoman were not immediately available for comment.
