Komani police are working around the clock trying to find the Sterkstroom granny who was kidnapped by the two armed men who robbed her home on Tuesday. Denise Bartlett – who is the mother of Enoch Mgijima local municipality councillor Lindy Haggard, who has confirmed her mother is still missing – was robbed at her home and kidnapped while her daughter, two granddaughters and a boyfriend of one of the granddaughters were locked in a toilet. The armed men kidnapped her and drove away in her lime green Chevrolet, which was later discovered at the Amberdale crossing, three kilometres outside of Komani. Komani police spokeswoman Captain Namhla Mdleleni said: “We still have not found any new information on the whereabouts of Bartlett.” She said a police task team comprising detectives, the K-9 dog unit and the flying squad were still searching for her. “We would like anyone with information to please contact the police on 086-001-0111,” she said. Mdleleni said the police had increased the number of police searching for the suspects. — thembiles@dispatch.co.za
