The stayaway by students of the University of Fort Hare in the East London campus has entered its second week this morning. Students have been boycotting classes since last week demanding the university provide accommodation for its more than 400 registered students who are still with no accommodation. East London campus premier Kwanele Ntantala told DispatchLive this morning that the campus remained closed. “Student leadership will set up a meeting with the management during the day, with the hope of subsequently finding an immediate solution. If in that meeting there are still contradictions with regards to provision of additional beds as we agreed in previous meetings, boycotting of classes will continue,” he said. University spokesman Khotso Moabi said the status of the accommodation issue in East London was under way to clear the backlog, “and we are prioritising Union Arcade students in the allocation”, he said. He said qualifying students  who applied, would also be allocated the available spaces. “Our management committee is still applying itself to the issue of acquiring additional beds should the need arise,” he said.
