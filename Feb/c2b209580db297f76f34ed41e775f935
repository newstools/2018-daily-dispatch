University of Fort Hare students are currently holding a mass meeting at their East London campus where they are discussing a way forward regarding their stayaway. The meeting comes a day after there was no agreement reached between the SRC and the management on Monday afternoon. Students has been boycotting lectures since last week demanding the management provides accommodation for more than 400 registered students that are still without a place to stay. During the meeting, students will decide whether to go start the academic year or carry on with the stayaway. Campus premier Kwanele Ntantala told DispatchLive this morning that the purpose of the meeting was to get a mandate from the students. “We will report on the outcome of the meeting we held with the management and hear what they have to say,” he said.
