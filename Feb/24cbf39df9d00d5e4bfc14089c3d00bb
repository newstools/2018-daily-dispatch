Reaction to the news that Jacob Zuma wants another three months as state president  has been pouring in thick and fast on social media. The Daily Dispatch reported today that Zuma agreed to resign but only in three months.  Some comments and tweets have lashed out at the ruling party and calling for an urgent departure of the 75-year-old. One user under the #ZumaRecall hashtag on twitter wrote: “It didn’t have to get to this point. He should have saved himself the humiliation and stepped down a long time ago”. Outspoken former ANC member Dr  Makhosi Khoza wrote on her twitter account that  Zuma should step down with those who elected him into power. “We need to get rid of all these leaders who propelled Zuma and protected him. What kind of leaders support Zuma? After Ace (Magushule) has delivered that letter he and all the corrupt individuals in the ANC must also face the music.” Watch the Daily Dispatch video what some locals say about the #Zexit.
