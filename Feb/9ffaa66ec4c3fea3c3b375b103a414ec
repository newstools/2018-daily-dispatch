A case of concealment has been opened with the Msobomvu police after a foetus was discovered at the Walter Sisulu University Bika campus in Butterworth on Tuesday. The foetus, believed to be four months old was discovered around 7am. It had been covered with grass between the campus buildings close to the students residence that accommodates both males and females, and not far from staff cottages. The stillborn girl was found by students who reported it to security guards. It’s believed the stillborn had been dumped on Monday night. No arrests have been made yet. University spokeswoman Yonela Tukwayo said: “I can confirm the unpleasant incident. The matter has been reported to the police and it is being handled by the Msobomvu police and it is being investigated.” Police spokesman Captain Jackson Manatha confirmed they were probing the matter. “We condemn illegal abortions as it safe to do abortions with a medical doctor or hospital. “We have arrested a few women in the past for concealment of birth and will continue to do so.” This is not a first incident of this nature to occur in a university. In 2011, a foetus was found at the University of Western Cape in a drain and last year a stillborn was found in a rubbish bin at the University of Fort Hare. — lisekhom@dispatch.co.za
