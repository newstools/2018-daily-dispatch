Shortly after President Jacob Zuma announced his resignation as president of South Africa in a televised statement on Wednesday night‚ enca reporter Nickolaus Bauer took to the streets of Braamfontein to get reaction from locals on the decision.  Things didn’t go as planned. One woman‚ who was in a car‚ referred to Zuma as a ‘motherf*****’ while another man said ‘f**k him.’ Even Bauer battled to maintain his composure at the end of the clip.
