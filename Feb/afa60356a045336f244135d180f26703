Ten ministers and three deputies who served under former president Jacob Zuma have been axed.  In announcing his inaugural cabinet on Monday night‚ President Cryil Ramaphosa not only named his ANC deputy David Mabuza as state deputy president but also wielded the axe to remove many of those who served under his predecessor. Among those fired by Ramaphosa are Nathi Nhleko‚ Fikile Mbalula‚ David Mahlobo‚ Faith Muthambi‚ Des van Rooyen‚ Mosebenzi Zwane‚ Joe Maswanganyi‚ Hlengiwe Mkhize‚ Senzeni Zokwana and Lynne Brown. Ramaphosa announced the changes on Monday evening to the media at Union Buildings shortly after 10pm. He said that the changes he made to the executive were to ensure national government was better equipped to implement its mandate. “These changes are intended to ensure that national government is better equipped to implement the mandate of this administration and specifically the tasks identified in the state of the nation address‚” Ramaphosa said. He said: “I have been conscious of the need to balance continuity and stability with the need for renewal‚ economic recovery and accelerated transformation.” An interesting development to Ramaphosa’s cabinet is the return former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene who will be reappointed to the position after being controversially fired in 2015. The ANC welcomed Ramaphosa’s announcement. “As the ANC‚ we particularly commend the president for having exercised this prerogative in consultation with the national officials of the ANC and our alliance partners. Undoubtedly‚ this act of giving due regard to the resolutions of the African National Congress‚ in the exercise of the prerogative bestowed upon the president‚ lays a strong foundation for greater alignment and cooperation between the ANC and its cadres deployed in government‚” spokesperson Pule Mabe said in a statement. He said the ANC congratulated Deputy President-elect Mabuza and other members who were appointed ministers and cabinet ministers. Below are the changes announced by Ramaphosa. Deputy President
