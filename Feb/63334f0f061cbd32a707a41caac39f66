The Democratic Alliance’s rising star‚ Phumzile Van Damme‚ has surprisingly quit her job as the party’s national spokesperson.  Van Damme reportedly told DA top brass of her decision two weeks ago‚ but the party has kept this under wraps due to the factional battle within the City of Cape Town where the party is trying to remove Patricia De Lille as mayor. She is the third high-profile member to quit a public post in recent months.
