Five people have lost their lives after a deadly head-on collision involving two Nissan bakkies between Mount Ayliff and Mount Frere at about 5pm on Sunday.  The occupants of both vehicles, two women and three men died at the scene of the crash. The vehicles were travelling from opposite directions, one from Mount Frere and the other from Mount Ayliff. Traffic provincial spokesman Charles Bramwell said it was alleged that one of the drivers was under the influence of alcohol. He said he was still waiting for more information  from the police. “Vehicle examiners are doing an investigation for the exact cause of the accident. Police are investigating a case of culpable homicide,” Bramwell said.
