Calm has returned to King Sabata Dalindyebo College’s Libode campus after weeks of protest action by disgruntled students. Students have been boycotting classes since January 17 calling for the removal of campus head, Thabo Nongawuza. They accused him of not allowing seven fellow students to register. Students then embarked on the protest in support of the seven. Four students were arrested last week when the protest turned violent. Students returned to class earlier this week amid reports that Nongawuza had been suspended. The college’s head of departments, Khuphukile Majeke, is acting in his position. When contacted yesterday, Nongawuza referred all questions to the principal of KSD College. “Call that number and ask to talk to the principal of the college,” he said. However, the principal was in a meeting in Pretoria and could not be reached. Acting campus head Khuphukile Majeke would only confirm that she was acting in Nongawuza’s position. She would not be drawn into commenting on the suspension or student action. She referred the Saturday Dispatch to the communications department of the college. However, a worker answered saying there was a meeting between the college management and student leadership. He refused to give his name, but did say the communications officer was not available. Sasco chairman at the college, Sanele Nxili, said students were not happy with Nongawuza. Nxili said the college had severe shortage of staff and study material, students were cramped in prefab structures that did not have enough furniture, while some buildings belonging to the college were rented out to a nursing college. Nxili said there was a task team that had been formed to investigate the allegations against Nongawuza. Nxili said the situation has returned to normal and students were attending classes.
