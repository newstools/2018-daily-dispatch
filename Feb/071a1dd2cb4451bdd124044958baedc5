The attack on a police station in Ngcobo in the Eastern Cape is “barbaric” and a “national tragedy”‚ a parliament committee said on Wednesday. A gang of robbers allegedly attacked the station in the small town‚ situated between Mthatha and Queenstown‚ in the early hours of the morning. At least six people‚ including police officers‚ were killed. Police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said an unknown number of armed suspects entered the police station and started shooting at members on duty. Francois Beukman‚ chairperson of the portfolio committee on police‚ said: “The attack and killing of police officers is an attack on the state and no stone must be left unturned to bring the perpetrators to justice.” The committee extended their condolences to the families of the victims and called for the implementation of recommendations to make police stations safer. Some of the recommendations include installing CCTV cameras in all police stations. National police commissioner General Khehla Sitole has appointed a specialised task team to investigate the attack. The committee called on community members to help track down the perpetrators.
