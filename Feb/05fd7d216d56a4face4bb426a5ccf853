Eleven pupils have been injured — one critically — after a seven-seater Toyota Avanza they were travelling in, overturned on the N2 near Dutywa. Eastern Cape department of transport spokeswoman Khuselwa Rantjie said the driver would be charged with negligent and reckless driving after he was caught transporting almost double the number  of passengers meant for the size of the vehicle. There were 12 passengers in the Avanza including the driver, said Rantjie. Rantjie said the accident occurred on the N2 road outside Dutywa near Doti Village towards Mthatha at 7.15am this morning. “The vehicle was travelling from Mthatha direction with 12 learners. The learners are from JSS Sikhenjana High School in Dutywa. It is alleged that the driver lost control of the vehicle entering the town. All occupants sustained injuries one female critically.” Rantjie said the injured pupils and the driver have been transported to Butterworth Hospital for medical assistance. “The vehicle was also overloaded as the carry capacity for the type of vehicle is seven.”
