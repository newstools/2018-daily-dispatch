Hundreds of police officers from across the Eastern Cape joined by Premier Phumulo Masualle and several church leaders from various denominations have arrived for the memorial service of the five police members and a military soldier who were massacred by armed gunmen last week. The families of the slain officers have also started to arrive and are welcomed by the policeâ€™s provincial brass band. The official memorial is expected to start shortly.
