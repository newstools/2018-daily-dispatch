The Bhisho legislature has today adopted a controversial report compiled by one of its committees which claims that majority of people in Matatiele want to remain in the Eastern Cape.
This after a heated debate during a sitting to consider the report by the portfolio committee in Cogta following public hearings in Matatiele last week. ANC which has majority of members of the legislature (MPLs) was the lone voice that agreed with the report while all opposition parties strongly opposed it.
The opposition argued that the report was not the true reflection of the will of people of Matatiele and instead called for a referendum.
