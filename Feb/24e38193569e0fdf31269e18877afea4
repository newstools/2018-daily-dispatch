A good deed to donate groceries to a needy family in Ziphunzana nearly took a fatal turn for an East London businessman. Pule Majeng, who owns a local funeral parlour in Duncan Village, was accosted by a gang of alleged criminals while making a delivery. He said he had stopped at a traffic circle in Ziphunzana when they tried to open his door and drag him out of the vehicle. “I tried to fight back and locked the doors immediately. I knew from the way they approached me they wanted to rob me,” said Majeng. He said he pulled out a gun, not knowing that they were also carrying their own. “My intentions were not to shoot them. I wanted to scare them off. Little did I know that they had two handguns,” he said. “One of them ran away, and from a distance started shooting, but only my bakkie was hit a few times.” He said he used his bakkie to deliver food he donates to struggling families in the area. “As one of the business owners who operate in the area, I always make it a point to assist where I can when I see that a family is in need.” Majeng said the area was a crime hotspot for muggings and that vehicle owners and schoolchildren were victims. East London police spokeswoman Warrant Officer Hazel Mqala confirmed that a case of attempted murder was opened. She said no arrests had been made. — zikhonam@dispatch.co.za
