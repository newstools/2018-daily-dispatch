Mbizana residents this weekend discovered the body of a man who is suspected to have been missing for almost a month.  According to provincial department of health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo, the man was found at the bottom a 200-metre cliff near Mzamba beach. “A man went missing in the community on January 16, and the community began the search a few days ago, assisted by their dogs as well and found him down the cliff on Saturday,” said Kupelo. He said, at the time of writing, emergency medical services were busy trying to retrieve the body. Police were unavailable to immediately comment but Kupelo said it was unclear how long the body had been lying at the bottom of the cliff. This is a developing story.
