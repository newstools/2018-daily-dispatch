ANC MP and chairperson of the portfolio committee on environmental affairs‚ Philly Mapulane‚ said there was pure frustration at Jacob Zuma’s refusal to leave office that made him question Zuma’s mental stability. Mapulane took to Twitter following Zuma’s live interview on SABC on Wednesday afternoon‚ and questioned whether something was “terribly wrong with him”. Zuma used the interview to justify his refusal to respect a decision by the ANC’s NEC to recall him from office. “After listening to JG Zuma on SABC this afternoon‚ I’m convinced there’s something terribly wrong with him. He’s either deranged‚ psychotic‚ insane‚ of unsound mind or just foolish. A man like him is very dangerous & we must expect anything before 2pm tomorrow‚” Mapulane tweeted. Mapulane‚ a former ANC NEC member‚ is known in the ANC for his anti-Zuma sentiment. He told TimesLIVE that he was very frustrated when he heard what Zuma said. “I mean‚ why are we going through all of this when he could have gone the easy way?” Mapulane said. He also questioned why Zuma attacked the ANC leadership and why he demanded an explanation for his recall from office. Earlier in the day‚ Mapulane asked on Twitter: “In who’s mandate is Jacob Zuma still occupying Union Buildings in complete defiance of the ANC NEC decision to recall Zuma?” The MP has also previously taken to social media to share his full support for ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa.
