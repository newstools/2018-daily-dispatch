The Eastern Cape ANC has fielded the first ever women-led troika in Council.  Councillor Nommvuzo Mlombile-Cingo was sworn in as Port St Johns municipality’s mayor on Wednesday. Mlombile-Cingo replaces the outgoing mayor Bulelwa Nokhanda, who is now the new Council Speaker. The Council’s former safety portfolio committee head Cebisa Mazuza was elected as the new Council Chief Whip. ANC provincial secretarary Lulamile Ngcukayitobi said this “confirms the ANC’s commitment to women empowerment”. The municipality located in the pristine Wild Coast, saw angry workers shutting operations last week over wage disputes. “We are more than confident that they will make drastic changes and create stability in PSJ. We will give them all the support they deserve and need,” said Ngcukayitobi.
