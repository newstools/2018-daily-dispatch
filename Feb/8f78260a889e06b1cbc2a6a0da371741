An emerging farmer who benefited from two multimillion-rand government grants – one to buy a farm and another to build an abattoir on it – is now suing the state for R4.3-million in damages he says he incurred because it did not build his abattoir in line within agreed time frames.  According to court papers, Sidumo Xashimba was awarded a grant in 2002 to buy a farm in Komani. In 2010, his farming business successfully applied for a R19.7-million grant to build an abattoir, and a feedlot and waste management site on the farm. The rural development and agrarian reform department awarded the tender to construction corporation Umuhle Developments.
