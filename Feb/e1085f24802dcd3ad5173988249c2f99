A protest over the removal of King Sabata Dalindyebo’s FET campus head in Libode turned violent this week when a bakkie belonging to the college was torched. Four students were arrested for public violence and appeared before the Libode Magistrate’s Court this morning. They were released on R500 bail each. EFF Student Command’s (EFFSC) Aphelele Nyalambisa told DispatchLive that the protest started last week when the management refused to admit seven students. “They say the students are causing trouble at the college. In solidarity, we then decided to embark on a strike,” she said. Nyalambisa said students then added other issues like the conditions of the college and 2016 allowance they did not get. Meanwhile, academic programmes at Buffalo City College’s John Knox Bokwe have been interrupted. Students demand the management provide them with accommodation.
