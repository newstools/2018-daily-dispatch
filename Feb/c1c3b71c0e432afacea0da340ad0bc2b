More than 50 Walter Sisulu University students who have been allocated at NBS residence in the CBD refuse to occupy the place saying it is not in a good condition. 
The students say the residence is dirty and is infested with cockroaches. 
A student, who spoke to DispatchLive on condition of remaining anonymous, said the residence has broken windows and overhanging ceilings. “It is just not in a good condition to accommodate students,” she said.
She said it was shocking for the university to even approve the place as a residence. 
In the meantime, dozens of students are waiting outside the venue at the university’s Eskom House site where the allocation is done.
Some say they have been coming to the venue since last week.
