The Eastern Cape education department has embarked on a campaign to bust its ghost teachers in three regions. The department rolled out the campaign this week, starting in Buffalo City Metro and Amathole East districts, while teachers who appear in the payroll system as “ghosts” from OR Tambo will have to verify their employment status next week. Close to 500 teachers from three education districts, whose names were listed in a full-page newspaper advertisement, with their persal numbers and schools, have been requested to go their nearest district office to produce their identity books at the payroll department. Pay point officials have to certify that the teachers are entitled to payment and principals have been asked to produce three months worth of registers to prove that the teachers are indeed teaching at the school. Provincial education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said the exercise was necessitated by some discrepancies on their payroll. “These discrepancies include reporting to the incorrect pay points and this normally occurs with teachers transferred from one school to another.” In Buffalo City Metro and Amathole, close to 400 teachers have to be verified. In BCM 136 teachers are listed as being from schools such as Shushu Primary School near King William’s Town, and Kuswag and Southernwood Primary schools in East London.In Amathole East, the department has called on 246 teachers to verify their employment status. In OR Tambo inland, close to 100 teachers will be called for the verification process next week from Monday to Friday. The department warned that teachers who failed to present themselves would have 14 days to verify themselves after these dates. If not, they will not be paid their salaries until they appear for the physical verification. — arethal@dispatch.co.za
