The Nelson Mandela Centenary celebrations kicked off in Mthatha at the Nelson Mandela Museum this afternoon. The afternoon was filled with hearty conversations and reflections by the members of Madiba’s Welcome Reception Committee who told some of the unknown moments leading up to Madiba’s release from prison. Some of the surviving members who were part of the committee include Saki Macozoma, Rose Sonto, Dali Mpofu, Bulelani Ngcuka, Hilda Ndude, Whitey Jacobs and Ben Sizani were present at the event. Sonto, who drove Mandela out Victor Verster prison, said he recalled how he “went week at the knees at the thought that he was tasked to carry cargo that was more precious that gold”. The Centenary Celebrations launch was coordinated by the Department of Tourism in collaboration with the National Heritage Council (NHC), South African Tourism (SAT) and the Nelson Mandela Museum.
