A cookie-baking run by four sisters in Maclear (population 10521) raised R4000 to help the town’s brightest matric maths and science pupil, Khuselo Nkunkuma, with his university studies. Nkunkuma matriculated with the school’s highest marks in maths, physics and life science. He achieved level 6 in maths and life science, and level 5 in physics. The Funani sisters, Zenande, Zokhanye, Zimasa and Zothando sold home-baked cookies to raise funds for pupils in their community. The sisters also raised donations from small businesses in Maclear. Zimasa Funani said the sisters were keen on community projects. They had taken part in sanitary-pad drives, and collected toys and clothing for children from struggling homes and the elderly. She said many pupils in the town had performed very well in matric but lacked funds to study further. These top achievers ended up sitting at home doing nothing. The sisters approached three schools in the community to identify the most deserving pupil in maths and science they could sponsor. “We wanted pupils to know that maths and science can be done and passed. “If our matrics can at least manage to pay their registration fees then they can try and get bursaries and apply to NSFAS (National Student Financial Aid Scheme) having already been admitted.” Thomas Ntaba school principal Themba Funani said Nkunkuma had worked hard. Teachers had told him Nkunkuma came from a poor family. “His mother is unemployed and he has had to move in with his aunt and uncle.” He said teachers had promised to help their matriculants during their studies at university. “Khuselo has made the school very proud and he is truly deserving of the donation. I would also like to say a big thank you to the Funani sisters for the wonderful work they do in the community. This donation will really make a difference. May they continue the great work,” he said.
