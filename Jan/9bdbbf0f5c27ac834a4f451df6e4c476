Are you curious to find out just how much you should be earning in your 30s? Salary comparison company PayScale may have the answers you seek in the results of their latest salary data research survey, released earlier this week. Careers included in the research are operations managers, office administrators, personal assistants, bookkeepers, credit controllers, as well as general and financial managers. Their average per annum salaries were calculated at R408 853, R136 003, R205 314, R181 998, R188 899, R397 414 and R560 037 respectively. The data is based on responses from 62559 South Africans who participated in the survey, all of whom have an average of 10 to 19 years of work experience. East London-based recruitment company Profile Personnel director Seaton Guess said the salaries listed in the PayScale survey were generally on par with those in the province. According to Guess, the average 30-year-old has eight to 10 years’ work experience, depending on whether they pursued a post matric qualification and at what age they had entered the job market. He said an Eastern Cape operations manager usually earned R408 000 per annum, a personal assistant from R72 000 to R180 000 and a bookkeeper from R120 000 to R216000. “Although I have to stress salaries are not necessarily age dependant but are based on education level and experience. In some industries it also comes down to the calibre of that specific person such as with a personal assistant or an office administrator,” Guess said. He added that the average employee’s career usually peaked in their 30s or 40s. “That happens if you stay in that particular industry for a number of years, have worked really hard and very clearly staked your claim; then you should see a definite peak in your career from about age 37 through to your early 40s. That should ideally be the highest position you acquire until you reach retirement age, provided you don’t change careers.” Based on further data provided by PayScale, salary amounts generally increase within the same age group with the same number of years of experience if they are coupled with some type of a post-matric qualification. Some respondents with a diploma earned R320 309 per annum, a higher diploma R379 277, a bachelor’s degree R570 564 and and a doctor of philosophy (PhD) R578 835. The PayScale data also provided average salaries based on employers, with banks and parastatals found to be paying the highest salaries to employees with 10 to 19 years’ experience. — zisandan@dispatch.co.za How much do you have to earn to live in South Africa’s richest suburbs and drive that brand new Maserati?
