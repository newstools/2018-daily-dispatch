The eMonti Jazz Society presents a tribute concert for Bra Willie, as Kgositsile was affectionately known, at the Velvet Jazz Club at the East London harbour at 7pm tonight. Kgositsile died last Wednesday at Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg after battling circulatory problems, family spokesman Terry Fowler said last week. He was 79-years old. Award-winning jazz artist Nduduzo Makhathini will entertain the crowd tonight. Event organiser Naniwe Mtshemla said paying tribute to Kgositsile with music was a fitting tribute to the celebrated poet and political activist, saying he had paved the way for many black artists. “It is important to honour such artists because the arts generally played a big role in unifying the people of South Africa against the apartheid system and risking their lives and families to free South Africa. “As a liberated people it is important to recognise their contributions and pay respects to those who came before us,” she said. The tribute for the late prominent member of the ANC coincides with the party’s 106th birthday celebration currently underway in East London. The official celebrations will be at Buffalo City Stadium on Saturday. Mtshemla encouraged music lovers and ANC members to attend the event. “We are expecting to see all types of people who knew Bra Willie and his work during the liberation struggle and especially jazz music lovers,” Mtshemla said. President Jacob Zuma has declared a special official funeral for Kgositsile. He will be buried on Tuesday. The president has ordered that the national flag be flown at half-mast at every flag station on Tuesday. Kgositsile was inaugurated in 2006 as South Africa’s second National Poet Laureate after the first National Poet Laureate Professor Mazisi Kunene. He was also a recipient of the National Order of Ikhamanga for his contribution to the field of literature. Tickets for the concert are R100 at the door. — lisekhom@dispatch.co.za
