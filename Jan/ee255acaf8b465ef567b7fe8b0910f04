East London police have launched a manhunt for the gang, who stormed in at Fleet Street Spar this evening ordering customers, mainly students, to hit the ground before fleeing with a large amount of business takings. The shop was packed, said a University of Fort Hare student. He posted on Facebook minutes after the gang fled: “I am traumatised. What I used to see on TV happened just now. “Five armed robbers entered Fleet Street Spar few minutes ago, took all the money in tills and left in less than five minutes. We were lying flat on the ground shaking with fear. I need counselling guys.” Warrant officer Hazel Mqala said police were responding.
