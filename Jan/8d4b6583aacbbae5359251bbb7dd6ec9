Eastern Cape MEC for rural development and agrarian reform, Mlibo Qoboshiyane, has warned maize farmers to be on the look-out for the fall armyworm. Qoboshiyane encouraged farmers to take time to inspect their crops. He said the Eastern Cape was the last province to be infested by the fall armyworm last year, where an estimated 355 hectares of planted maize were infested. Qoboshiyane said most of the affected maize were late planted maize. “So far the prevailing environmental conditions in the province, accompanied by further late planting, may be conducive for the development of a fall armyworm outbreak as we saw last year,” he said. The political head said similar to the approach used in 2017, training of extension officers and scientific technicians on scouting techniques, identification of fall armyworm and spraying methodologies will be periodically conducted throughout the growing season. “Awareness campaigns on most radio stations in the province and other media outlets is an ongoing exercise.” Qoboshiyane said the eggs of the worms are laid in masses on the underside of the leaves mostly, and on stems. The eggs may be cream, green, white or brown in colour. “As the larvae feeds on the young maize plant, it creates window holes on the young leaves as well as on the growing point. In older maize plants, one must look at the cobs/ears, where the larvae feed on soft tissues like kernels, soft inner leaves, and silk hairs,” he said. Qoboshiyane said farmers must immediately report any signs. Farmers are advised to contact the department’s local and district offices for assistance. — zolilem@tisoblackstar.co.za
