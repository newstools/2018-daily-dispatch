AmaXhosa King Mpendulo Zwelonke Sigcawu led a prayer session yesterday addressing the drought, the incarceration of King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, as well the many social ills affecting the country. The king invited leaders from many African religions, as well as other Christians, Muslims and Hindus to converge at his Nqadu Great Place in Willowvale to pray for divine intervention. The prayer meeting, also attended by Western Thembuland King Siyambonga Dalimvula Matanzima and representatives from the AbaThembu BakaDalindyebo, also prayed for good leadership from the king, moral regeneration, improved education and job creation, unity, harmony of the nation and political tolerance. “Crime in the country has reached alarming proportions. It respects no king or judge or senior police, it affects us all,” said the king, adding that his place had been been burgled a number of times, during both his reign and during the reign of his late father King Xolilizwe Sigcawu. “We have had 25 computers organised for the community of Nqadu all stolen. Also in my office, a laptop was stolen. Cattle are stolen and I too have been a victim there,” said Sigcawu. The king said that he had done all he could to fight crime and the decaying of moral fibre of his community and now he was appealing to the power of God. “I am fed up with the increasing levels of of crime, which now include elements never seen before, like cannibalism, the killing and raping of mothers by their own children,” he said. “The high rates of corruption and maladministration in our government, in municipalities and other organs of state. We are living in a sick society with eroded morals and values – humanity is going to the dogs. It is for these reasons and many others I embarking on a campaign to revive ubuntu and moral regeneration.” — lulamilef@dispatch.co.za
