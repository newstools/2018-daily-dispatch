An eight-year-old pupil, who has refused to go school for a year, is at the centre of a messy feud between her mother and her former class teacher. The child was attending a primary school outside King William’s Town. Her mother claimed the child’s teacher humiliated her daughter by using ugly words and accusing her of witchcraft. The child, who has not gone to school since February last year, is apparently too fearful to return. Education spokesman Mali Mtima said: “We tried by all means to get the child to go back to school but the agreement was the child should get counselling so that she would be able to go back to class.” He said the department sent delegates to speak to the mother about the importance of her child returning to school. “We wanted to have a sit-down meeting with the mother and the teacher so they could reconcile but the mother refused. “If she agrees to reconcile we will work with her willingly as this will be beneficial to the child,” Mtima said. Khula community development project, a Peddie-based organisation which focuses on victims of abuse, also intervened last year. Director Petros Majola, said: “We are appealing to the provincial government to prioritise this matter and stop talking about it in their comfort zones.” Majola said education department superintendent general Themba Kojana appointed someone to work on the case last year. However, he was shocked to discover the child was still at home. “If the department doesn’t take necessary steps we will take legal action,” he said. King William’s Town police spokeswoman captain Siphokazi Mawisa said an investigating officer was busy working on the case. The girl’s mother said: “I tried to force her to go to school but she refused, saying she was too afraid. There are other schools but they are far. I am unemployed, I do not have money for scholar transport and a new uniform.” — zikhonam@dispatch.co.za.
