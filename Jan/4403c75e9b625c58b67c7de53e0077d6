The survivor of last nightâ€™s taxi violence-related shooting in Mthatha is in a stable condition in hospital. 
Lonwabo Sitoya, 27, sustained multiple gunshot wounds when he and another person he was with were shot. The man, whose identity has not been released by police, died during a shooting near Circus Triangle in the Mthatha CBD last night.
At least three people have died since the taxi violence erupted again in the Mthatha area since Wednesday last week. Taxi operators have been at loggerheads over taxi routes in the areas since last year.
No arrests has been made in all the incidents.
