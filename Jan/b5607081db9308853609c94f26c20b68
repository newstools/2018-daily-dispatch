Operations at the Bhisho legislature ground to a halt today when close to 100 workers downed tools and protested at the institution’s main gate and in front of the Raymond Mhlaba chamber. The Nehawu-alligned workers are protesting over the institution’s alleged failure to timeously deal with their grievances, including the probing of alleged nepotism and irregularities at the institution’s supply chain management (SCM) unit. Their protest action started this morning and is set to go on indefinitely until, according to Nehawu, all their grievances which were submitted to management in a form of a memorandum late last year, “are adequately addressed”.
Today’s protest action also saw some legislature officials who were meant to accompany multi-party MPLs, including the education portfolio committee members, in visiting schools across the province this week, abandoning sites and joining their colleagues in Bhisho for the protest action.
