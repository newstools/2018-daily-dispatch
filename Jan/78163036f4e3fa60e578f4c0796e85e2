A dangerous criminal who was with three others when they pulled off a fantastical escape from Mdantsane prison did the dumbest thing. He went straight home. Sandile Vena, 22, from King William’s Town, was brought down at Midenge village in Peelton with little fuss by a special task force of the Correctional Services Department at 3pm yesterday. Villagers easily spotted him and were quick to tip off the prison. A special task team waited in the bush where he was camping and apparently spending nights at home, and when Vena came in from the spaza shop they pounced. The provincial Correctional Services commissioner, Nkosinathi Breakfast, said Vena had been living with his family since Thursday, a mere day after the gang’s astounding escape, which has seen 13 warders facing an internal inquiry. Breakfast said Vena, who is serving a 23-year sentence for rape, robbery and kidnapping and has a pending case for kidnapping, had ruined his chance of parole. Vena, Lihle Zikholisile, 19, from Mthatha, Norman Makuwunendo, 22, from Zimbabwe and Phikolomzi Sonakele, 23, from Mqanduli, escaped during breakfast on Wednesday. — malibongwed@dispatch.co.za
