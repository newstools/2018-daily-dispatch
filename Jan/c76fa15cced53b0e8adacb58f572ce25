A parent was punched in a scuffle involving protesting members of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) outside Hoërskool Overvaal in Vereeniging early on Wednesday. He had tried to stop a black parent from driving past Hoërskool Overvaal as she was hooting and had her fist in the air.   Police had to separate parents and protesters at the Afrikaans school‚ which recently scored a legal victory in keeping out 55 Grade 8 English learners. Racial tensions flared up after the ruling‚ with black parents shouting “away with racism”. A parent was taken into the school grounds after apparently being punched by an EFF supporter in the face. The parent had earlier made a rude gesture towards EFF protesters before accompanying his daughter into the school premises. -TimesLIVE
