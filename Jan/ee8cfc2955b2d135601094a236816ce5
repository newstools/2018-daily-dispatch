The effect of the ruling… August 18, 2016 The National Energy Regulator of SA (Nersa) will on Tuesday continue its public hearings on Eskom's application for the evaluation and approval of the regulatory clearing account (RCA) balance for the financial year 2013/2014 of the third multi-year price determination (MYPD3.
