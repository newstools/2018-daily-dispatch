One of the four dangerous fugitives who escaped from the Mdantsane medium prison on Wednesday has been rearrested. Sandile Vena,22, from King Willaim’s Town, was arrested at 3pm today by a special task force of the Eastern Cape Correctional Services Department.
He was arrested in the bushes of his home village of Midenge in Peelton following a tip-off from villagers. Eastern Cape Correctional Services department commissioner Nkosinathi Breakfast said Vena had been staying with his family since Thursday-a day after his daring escape.
Breakfast said they were not aware where Vena spent his first night after his escape. Breakfast said Vena, who is serving 23 year sentence for rape, robbery and kidnapping, and a pending case for kidnapping, was arrested on his way from a spaza shop. He had a pending case for robbery with aggravating circumstances on April 18. Breakfast said a case of escaping from lawful custody would be added on his charge sheet.
Vena would appear in the Mdantsane Magistrate’s Court tommorow.
