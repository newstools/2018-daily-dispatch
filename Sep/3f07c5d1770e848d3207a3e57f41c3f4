A South African vlogger and Facebook user who calls himself Devdondidit found a loaf of bread at Woolworths for R54 - and decided to make a video about it. In the video‚ discussing the price‚ he asks: "Did Jesus bake this bread?" He says it's his first day on a diet so he thought‚ "Let me come to Woolworths and buy me gluten-free bread." And then he saw the price. We have contacted Woolworths for comment and are awaiting its reponse.
