The Port Elizabeth High Court on Thursday dismissed an application by the DA and its coalition partners challenging a council decision that led to the removal of Athol Trollip as mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay. Trollip was ousted through a motion of no confidence during a council meeting last month. The ruling paves the way for his nemesis‚ the UDM’s Mongameli Bobani‚ to stay on as mayor of the city. This is a developing story.
