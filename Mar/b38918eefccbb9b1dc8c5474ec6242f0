Yet another Eastern Cape mayor has resigned from her post a mere 19 months into her five-year deployment term.  This after her party, the ANC, felt her municipality was one of those so chaotic that it needed a change of guard. The embattled Mnquma Municipality mayor Thobeka Bikitsha tendered her resignation as mayor, but will remain an ordinary ANC councillor in her municipality until further deployment. This after she was ordered by the ruling party to resign. Bikitsha tendered her resignation letter to the party’s provincial executive last Friday. Bikitsha today confirmed to the Daily Dispatch that she has indeed relinquished her Mnquma mayoral chain. She confirmed that she did so on the instruction of the ANC’s provincial executive committee. “I don’t even take such a move in a negative light because it was the same party that had deployed me, and it is the same party which has asked me to step down,” Bikitsha said. Her resignation comes hot on the heels of Port St Johns mayor Bulelwa Nokhanda’s resignation last month, also after being ordered to do so by the ANC. Nokhanda has since been replaced by former ANC MPL Nommvuzo Mlombile-Cingo.
