Services at the busy BP Garage on Fleet Street, East London, were halted today as workers down tools claiming their wages had not been paid. Frustrated motorists hooted in anger for assistance to no avail, with some even opting to get out of their cars to pump their own car tyres, as petrol attendants watched from a distance. Office clerks moved to operate the Pick n Pay convenience store on the premises.
Speaking to the Daily Dispatch, the petrol attendants, tellers and kitchen staff said a failure to pay fortnightly salaries, due to them on Thursday, was the final straw of what they could endure from their employer Johan Kleyn. Refuting the claims, Kleyn, who was on the premises the entire day, said the delay in payments was caused by a system failure yesterday. He accused some employees of intimidating all of the staff to cease all operations. “Their salaries were processed on Thursday. Yesterday the system crashed. They were informed that there would be delays…”
Kleyn said the downing of tools by the staff was a “demonic onslaught on the business.”
“If they [workers] want to prove a point, what can I say?… let them prove it.”-nonsindisoq@dispatch.co.za
