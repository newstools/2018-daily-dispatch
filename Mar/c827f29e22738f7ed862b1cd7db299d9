A University of Fort Hare student at the East London campus has opened a case of assault after she was allegedly beaten up by a fellow student. University spokesman Khotso Moabi confirmed the matter to the Saturday Dispatch. Police spokeswoman Warrant Officer Hazel Mqala said a case of assault and malicious damage to property was opened. The two students, who live in different residences in Quigney, met at a nightclub in the area on Sunday night, and the male student allegedly insisted on buying wine for the woman student. The woman said she was with her female friend when the man and his friend approached them. She said the [men], who stay at Jail House residence, then insisted on accompanying them to their Ocean View residence. “We thanked them for accompanying us, not that we wanted them to, but we told them we were safe [and] they could leave. One of them started to assault me until I was bleeding through my nose,” she said. “Things could have been worse [if] other students did not intervene,” she said. Moabi said the men involved in the alleged incident were registered students at the university. He said the matter was under investigation and disciplinary measures would be taken. “As the university we condemn this kind of behaviour. They have no place in our institution. Such behaviour will not be tolerated,” he said. Two rooms of the residence were also damaged during the scuffle. — sinom@dispatch.co.za
