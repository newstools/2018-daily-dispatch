Athol Trollip’s campaign to remain as Nelson Mandela Metro mayor received a major boost at the eleventh hour this evening, after the Patriotic Alliance resolved to support the Democratic Alliance, when the motion of no confidence vote against Trollip is tabled Thursday. At 6:30pm PA’s president Gayton Mckenzie told the Daily Dispatch that they had decided to support the DA .  The PA which has one councillor in the Port Elizabeth based Council, tried to strike a deal with the DA to give its councillor Marlon Daniels the safety and security mayoral seat in return for support, while the party also offered Economic Freedom Fighters its support on condition that the party supports a move to recreate the deputy mayor position in the Council. The DM position was removed last year following the DA’s controversial decision to recall United Democratic Movement’s Mongameli Bobani. Daniels played a critical role in favour of the DA when it needed votes to recall Bobani. The EFF, which would table the motion of no confidence against Trollip at Thursday’s Council meeting, told Daniels to find other allies as it would not agree to support any plans to recreate the deputy mayor position. The DA had until 5pm yesterday to make the choice, and PA’s resident Gayton Mc Kenzie confirmed yesterday that his party would give the DA its vote .  “ Good evening we are going with the DA ,” said McKenzie .
