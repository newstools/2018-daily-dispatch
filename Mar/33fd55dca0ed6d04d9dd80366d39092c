A young Gonubie gardener who snatched four cellphones from his employer’s home and later pointed a toy gun at his head while being chased by him was yesterday sentenced to three years in prison in the East London Magistrate’s Court.  Khayalethu Ngaka, 25, from Gonubie’s Mzamomhle informal settlement, had initially faced a charge of robbery with aggravating circumstances. He pleaded not guilty to that charge and instead pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of theft. The court acquitted him on the initial charge, convicted him of theft and sent him to jail. “For the full story get a copy of the Dispatch or subscribe to our e-Edition for the complete newspaper with jobs, classifieds, crosswords, TV schedules and back editions”.
