A Nelson Mandela Bay council meeting descended into chaos on Thursday and speaker Jonathan Lawack indefinitely adjourned the gathering.  A motion of no confidence against Mayor Athol Trollip‚ to be tabled by the EFF‚ was set to be discussed. A scuffle broke out when DA councillor Rano Kayser allegedly touched EFF councillor Zilindile Vena. This led to DA leader Mmusi Maimane intervening before city manager Johann Mettler also attempted to calm the councillors down. Other councillors such as Lukhanyo Mrara also got involved in an attempt to defend their leaders. TimesLIVE put together five moments that defined the chaotic council meeting on Thursday morning.
