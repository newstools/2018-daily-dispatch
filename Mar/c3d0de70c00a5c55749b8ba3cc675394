The trial of three Mdantsane men who stand accused of killing a 61-year old NU13 woman, inside her house and in front of her 26-year-old autistic son, and later killing her 23-year-old son, was today postponed by the Bhisho High Court when one of the accused allegedly fell ill.  The trio – Luthando Kondile, 28, Hlumani Baleka, 20, and Lindokuhle Makaula – today appeared before high court Judge Feziwe Rengqe for the second time this week. They are accused of shooting Nonkululeko Swartbooi in the head in her home lounge during a house robbery between April 20-26 in 2015, in front of her ailing son Wola, while they later went on to kill her other son, Libona “Jigga” Swartbooi, 23. The trial, which started on Tuesday, will resume again next Monday.
