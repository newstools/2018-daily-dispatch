The Oscar Mabuyane-led provincial executive committee (PEC) is still in charge of the ANC in the Eastern Cape.  This after the ANC’s highest decision-making body, in between conferences, the national executive committee (NEC) resolved on Sunday to set aside the controversial Sbu Ndebele report. The report investigated events leading to the violence and throwing of chairs that characterised the provincial elective conference last October. The conference was held in East London It was then tabled at the NEC held in Cape Town over the weekend. A few pages purported to be part of the Ndebele report were leaked on social media a few weeks ago, which recommended that the PEC would be disbanded and replaced with a task team led by Mabuyane and Premier Phumulo Masualle. But DispatchLIVE can reveal today that contents of the report were criticised heavily at the NEC meeting, with some NEC members labelling it as one sided. ANC provincial secretary Lulama Ngcukayitobi would not be drawn into discussing details of what happened behind closed doors on Sunday. He would only say: “The Ndebele report was noted and set aside. The PEC was affirmed.” The decision ends months of confusion and uncertainty within the ANC and the provincial government as to who is in charge between Mabuyane and Masualle – as the two have been at loggerheads since the chaotic conference.
