Easter is a time where family comes together to enjoy some quality time and delicious spoils. For some underprivileged children in East London this feeling is only but a dream. Enkazimulweni Ncedani Life Centre in Duncan village is on a mission to make a difference with children battling some harsh realities. The home is a haven for abandoned, abused and HIV-affected children. Damelin East London Campus along with Whisper Restaurant have come together to give back this Easter in a heartfelt ‘feel-good day’ tomorrow for the children of Enkazimulweni. The day will consist of a braai and many fun activities. “We hope the community at large will assist us in supporting Enkazimulweni by giving back to the less fortunate. As a business, Whisper Restaurant is eager to give back to the community and with time and interest shown by other local business, this dream can come alive,” said owner Khululekile Sixaba. Enkazimulweni Ncedani is run by 64-year-old Nonkululeko Maneli, who began her work with children 27 years ago in her own home. “I currently have 14 children under my wing. I love them all so dearly. With God’s help I have been able to provide for them and make them feel safe. My youngest is a year old while the eldest is 27 years old,” said Maneli. Enkazimulweni is an organisation driven by the love and the prayers of strong mother who has the dream of seeing desolate young people achieve. Maneli says she could not do it without the support of the community. “People give back to us in different ways, some donate school uniforms, fees, clothing and toys to the children. They never go without,” said Maneli. Whisper Restaurant will be hosting an event this evening at the venue where all proceeds will go to Enkazimulweni. The entrance fee for tonight is an item of children’s clothing. Tomorrow the team will head to Duncan Village in the hope of brightening Enkazimulweni’s Easter Weekend.
