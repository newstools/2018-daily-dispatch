Teaching and learning was brought to a halt at Breidbach High School this morning as parents and community members woke up as early as 7am and locked the school’s gates in protest over the shortage of teachers. According to pupils and parents, the school was short of five teachers, this include teachers for geography, mathematics, life science, economics and management science and life orientation. The parents have vowed to keep the gates locked until the teachers were permanently appointed. When the Dispatch arrived at the school at around mid-morning,  pupils and staff were locked out of the school except for close to 100 pupils who live at the school’s hostel.
