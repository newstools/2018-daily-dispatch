A mother and her two children were among 14 people who lost their lives near Satan’s Neck on Wednesday night. The family from a Ngqeleni village was among 60 passengers that were inside the Vaal Maseru bus that overturned on the R58 between Ngcobo and Elliot. Department of health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo told DispatchLive that he has just broken the news to the family of the deceased this evening. “They are still on the road now probably very traumatized – I just broke the news about the mother,” he said.
