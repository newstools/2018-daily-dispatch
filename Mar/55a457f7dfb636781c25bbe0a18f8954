Walter Sisulu University has shut down its Buffalo City campus following disruption on academic activities since Monday.  University spokeswoman Yonela Tukwayo told DispatchLIVE this morning that operations on the campus have been disrupted since Monday afternoon. “Students declared a strike demanding that their accommodation issues be resolved first,” said. SRC secretary Luvo Quvile has told DispatchLIVE that student leaders were scheduled to have a meeting with campus management committee this morning to discuss a way forward. “We will then have a mass meeting with students to report back the outcomes of the meeting,” he said. Buffalo City Campus rector Dr Prince Jaca sent an email to all staff members informing them of the unrest on the campus. In the email, Jaca said his office had received a written memorandum of grievances and declaration of strike. “This is to inform you that a special campus management committee (MCM) meeting with the SRC is convened for 7th March, to look at all those issues that have been raised by the SRC. “I am hopeful that the MCM and the SRC will be able to find each other as they have done in the past,” he said. Jaca said it was the wish of the management that the issues students raised could be resolved speedily, “so that our campus can continue as normal”, he said.
