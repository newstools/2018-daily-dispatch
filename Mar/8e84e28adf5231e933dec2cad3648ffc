The popular Eastern Beach in East London has been closed to the public until further notice after the sea water was contaminated by raw sewage.  The beach was closed on Tuesday following a massive sewage spill from a broken municipal pipe, lifeguards told the Dispatch today. But Buffalo City spokesman Samkelo Ngwenya said the municipality closed the beach as precautionary measure whilst undertaking water quality tests. The news will disappoint thousands of Easter holidaymakers and beachgoers who were hoping to visit the popular beach. Ngwenya said it was not clear when the beach would be opened as the municipality was waiting for water quality test results which will determine whether the water could be cleared for swimming.
