She is normally shy and reserved, but 17-year-old Sovuya Jack, a Grade 11 pupil at Nqweba Secondary School in Graaff-Reinet, beat her peers from eight schools when she was crowned Eastern Cape National Library Week winner last week. Sovuya faced stiff competition from her peers, but she excelled in reviewing former president Nelson Mandela’s autobiography, Long Walk To Freedom. Sovuya was crowned provincial winner after she presented a “captivating” review of the book. The department of sport, recreation, arts and culture, in partnership with the Dr Beyers Naude Municipality, hosted the library week competition under the theme “Libraries: Heart of the Community” in Graaff-Reinet last week. Sovuya walked away with a tablet, a dictionary, pens, a school bag and an external hard drive. “I cried tears of joy when they announced me as the winner. It felt good to know that my review was the best,” said Sovuya. Her isiXhosa teacher, Nombeko Sontlaba, described Sovuya as a pupil who normally keeps to herself in class. “I am so proud of Sovuya. She is normally shy and reserved but she has learnt to open up and address a crowd with confidence,” she said. National library week provincial programme leader Lubabalo Dzedze described last week’s event as a huge success. — gugup@dispatch.co.za
