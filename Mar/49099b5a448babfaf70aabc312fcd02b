An injured juvenile African crowned eagle was taken to the Nahoon vet on Monday, where it was discovered it had been shot with a pellet gun. The bird, which at six months old is already quite a heavyweight (an adult bird can weigh up to 4.7kg), was found by Nahoon residents Jilly Gooud and Deon Mcquirk on Sunday. Gooud has closely monitored the eagle’s parents for the past three years, and was assisted by neighbour Mcquirk who helped him take the bird to Dr Storm van Tonder at the Nahoon Bird and Animal Clinic on Monday. “For the full story get a copy of the Dispatch or subscribe to our e-Edition for the complete newspaper with jobs, classifieds, crosswords, TV schedules and back editions”.
