When Vicki Momberg goes to sleep tonight‚ behind the bars of a Johannesburg prison‚ the former estate agent will leave her own indelible mark on South African history. The 49-year-old will become the first person in the country’s history to be jailed for crimen injuria‚ defined as a “wilful injury to someone’s dignity‚ caused by the use of obscene or racially offensive language or gestures”.

Prosecutions boss Shaun Abrahams told Times Select that Momberg’s effective two-year jail term is a “victory”.
