Armed with confidence and coffee, thousands of hopefuls lined up at the Nelson Mandela Bay stadium from early morning yesterday in the hopes of nabbing a chance at the small screen. The Presenter Search on 3 team visited the Bay yesterday as the first stop on a nationwide campaign to find aspiring television presenters for the new season of the SABC3 reality show. Though the auditions began from 8am, many queued from as early as 6am for their shot at fame. Among these early birds were Mxolisi Makhubu, 26, and Victor Sejane, 23, who drove from Bloemfontein for the auditions. By 2pm they were still waiting for their turn, but Makhubu, a sales executive, said they had chosen to come to Port Elizabeth as auditions in Johannesburg would bring even longer queues. Though he was nervous, Makhubu said he enjoyed the interaction with other participants. “The atmosphere is amazing. You meet a lot of fun-loving people,” he said. Sejane, an accounting student, said he’d been nervous since the minute he heard about the auditions. “This is my passion. I want to get paid for speaking,” he said. “I want to act and go to America, and one day I’d like to go into politics.” Local student Lizelle Pienaar, 21, said she relished the chance to audition. “I just have to be myself,” says Pienaar. “I love new challenges like this, and no challenge is too big.” Her mother, Zelda, who was at her side for moral support, praised the other contestants. “It’s amazing to see so many young people with so much potential together,” she said. Further auditions will be held in Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg in April, ahead of the new season’s premiere on May 10. — parfitto@tisoblackstar.co.za
