Some thought the pair were pulling a major pr stunt as they posted snaps of themselves looking cosy after the video was done and dusted. But if it’s a stunt‚ the couple are really giving it gas‚ because weeks later‚ they’re always side-by-side. Kelly and Chad recently celebrated her birthday with a romantic getaway and often refer to each other as king and queen. Whether it’s a stunt or not‚ Kelly and Chad are serving the sauce. In abundance. TshisaLIVE made several attempts to get comment from Kelly.
