The mother of the 14-year-old girl who was prostituted by four self-confessed prostitutes in Whittlesea in 2016 stormed out of the courtroom crying as her daughter on a second day relived the ordeal of being sold to foreign nationals for sex. The victim told the Komani regional court how she was sold for R80 for sex to a third foreigner old enough to be her father. Xolelwa Garhisha, Yolanda Klaas, Zintle Tom and Nwabisa Kaziwa are facing charges of human trafficking while a foreign national Harun Mohammed faces charges of statutory rape. "After selling me to two foreigners on the first day, on the second day they took me to another cash and carry where they sold me to an old man with a big belly. After the man had sex with me we went back home and they brought me to a second man in the same shop who also had sex with me," she said. She said all the occasions when the foreign nationals had sex with her she would cover her face crying out loud but the foreigners would continue until they finished. The trial continues.
