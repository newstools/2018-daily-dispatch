The murders occurred in and around Port Elizabeth in August and December 2017.

Sgt Mzuku’s state issued Z88 pistol was also taken.“On Thursday, 21 December 2017 at about 11.15pm, two on duty police officers were shot at by suspects after they responded to a panic alarm at a business premises in Paterson Road in North End. As they were waiting at the gate of the premises, they were attacked by two unknown persons and several shots were fired at the police officers. Constable Nomvuybeko Mjandana succumbed to her injuries at the scene while her colleague was wounded.
