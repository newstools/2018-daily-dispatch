A local woman was hijacked in Vincent Road around midday Thursday after allegedly being followed from the bank. Messages on a community whatsapp group and to the Daily Dispatch claim that the victim was allegedly followed from the bank before being forced off the road, having a gun held to her head and being robbed of  R1000, her keys and her cellphone. Captain Mluleki Mbi, of the SAPS, confirmed the incident saying: “She [the victim] was robbed of cash and [her] cellphone by two unknown suspects, no shots fired, and no injuries.” Mbi added that it was indeed “possible” that the woman, who is “about 25”, was followed from the bank but said that such incidents were “not at all” common in the area. “People need to be always vigilant, a case was opened at the Cambridge police station,” he said.
