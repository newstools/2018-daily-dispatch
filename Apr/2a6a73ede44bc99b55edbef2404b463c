Twitter is in awe of Zenani Mandela-Dlamini’s damning speech at her mother Winnie’s funeral service in Orlando‚ Soweto. Mandela-Dlamini reminded the crowd of the treatment that her mother Madikizela-Mandela was subjected to throughout her life. She said many who are mourning her today have helped peddle lies about her‚ “don’t think for a second that we have forgotten”.      Many compared her to the Economic Freedom Fighter’s leader‚ Julius Malema as an assertive firebrand.  Some social media users also spared a thought for Mad Zoleka Before Madikizela-Mandela died in a Johannesburg hospital last Monday‚ she had attended a Good Friday sermon at church with her granddaughter‚ Zoleka Mandela. Twitter spared a thought for her: https://twitter.com/Pununum/status/985073347707985920/photo/1 Madikizela-Mandela will be laid to rest at the Fourways Memorial Park.
