The mood changed dramatically when EFF leader Julius Malema arrived at the home of the late Winnie Madikizela-Mandela on Tuesday.  Malema was accompanied by EFF leaders Floyd Shivambu and Dali Mpofu to Madikizela-Mandela’s dwelling in Orlando West‚ Soweto. Malema’s red Mercedes-Benz led a crowd of vocal EFF members who had been gathering nearby‚ singing struggle songs. For the first time‚ the main gate at the house was closed by men controlling access into the home. Instantly the crowd quadrupled after Malema’s arrival. As the EFF members continued in song‚ a group of ANC Women’s League members who had come to offer their prayers to the family walked out the gate singing a song that lashed out at Malema for leaving the ANC. The women were accompanied by former KwaZulu-Natal premier Zweli Mkhize. Madikizela-Mandela had been close to Malema and encouraged him to return to the ruling party. The struggle icon died on Monday at the age of 81 at the Netcare Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg. She died after a long illness‚ for which she had been in and out of hospital since the start of the year. -TimesLIVE
