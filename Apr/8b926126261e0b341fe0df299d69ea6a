The Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) joined the chorus of praise following the death of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela on Monday‚ saying that the late struggle activist proved to the world that women could lead in all spaces they found themselves. “Mama Winnie has proven beyond our continent that women can lead not only their families but in the entire society in various frays‚ especially in politics which usually is dominated by powerful‚ rich males. Mama Winnie was the bedrock of her family when her husband was imprisoned with many of our comrades into Robben Island. She remained in that distant marriage and became the pillar of her family for 27 years‚” said the PAC’s spokesperson‚ Kenneth Mokgatlhe. On Monday afternoon‚ the world was shocked to learn that Madikizela-Mandela passed away at the Netcare Milpark Hospital. The 81-year-old had been in and out of hospital since January with what a spokesman at the time said was a kidney infection. Mokgatlhe said the party saluted Mama Winnie for all the she achieved. “Women must emulate her by ensuring that they become role players not only in politics but in other societal areas such as the economy‚ religion and others‚” he said.
