Members of the South African National Defence Force and Johannesburg Metropolitan Police accompanied the coffin of late struggle stalwart Winnine Madikizela-Mandela as it left her home from her home to Orlando Stadium a few kilometres away. SANDF members were present at the funeral of Madikizela-Mandela because President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that she would receive a special official funeral. The coffin‚ draped in the South African flag‚ was in a black minibus and it was accompanied by vehicles carrying family and close friends of Madikizela-Mandela as her remains left her home for the last time. A number of buses made its way together with the convoy lead by the hearse‚ with military police in motorcycles flanking the hearse. President Cyril Ramapphosa’s motorcade also joined the cortege.
