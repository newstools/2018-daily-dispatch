 A Matatiele traffic officer has been suspended after he was arrested in connection with committing serious criminal offences. Matatiele mayor Momelezi Mbedla said the 30-year-old officer was allegedly involved in a business robbery, but upon his capture was allegedly found in possession of an unlawful firearm and stolen property. “We view the above allegations as very serious. “It is a very disturbing and serious incident that contravenes the objectives of local government, which are to promote a stable and healthy environment,” said Mbedla. The official was arrested with two men aged 22 and 38, and accused of being involved in a business robbery in Mkhamane village in Matatiele last month. He said the official was employed by the municipality in March 2017. The official’s criminal record was clean at the time of engagement and the officer was off duty when he allegedly committed the crime. “As [the Matatiele municipality] leadership we remain committed to clean governance and provision of a healthy work environment for all,” he said. Matatiele municipal spokeswoman Olwetu Gwanya said the suspects would appear in the Maluti Magistrate’s Court in Maluti soon for possession of suspected stolen property and robbery. — ziphon@dispatch.co.za
