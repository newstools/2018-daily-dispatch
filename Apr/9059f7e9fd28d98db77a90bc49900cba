 Well-known Eastern Cape football club boss Rodney “Mash” Mashaya who has been languishing in jail for the past three weeks for theft committed in 2009, will have to spend another 13 days in custody before his fate could be determined by the court. The troubled civil engineer, who owns the East London-based ABC Motsepe provincial league outfit FC Buffalo, was arrested late last month after he had failed to comply with conditions of his 2016 suspended sentence. Mashaya was found guilty in 2016 by Komani regional magistrate Onika van Papendorp of the 2009 theft of over R240 000 from Ikhala TVET College in Komani – money he unlawfully spent after it had been deposited in the account of his company, Zezethu Engineers. He was sentenced to a five-year jail term, which was suspended for five years on condition he repaid the money he misappropriated. He however failed to do so, resulting in his arrest last month for non-compliance with conditions of his suspended sentence. He appeared in the Komani court today and his case was postponed to April 25 for judgment.
