After the 100th birthday celebrations of Noyose Mabel Gija over the weekend, where premier Phumulo Masualle was a special guest, the Daily Dispatch was alerted of another granny who had reached the milestone. Centenarian Nomvula Ngcikiza celebrated her 100th birthday on March 31 at the Summit Lifestyle centre in East London. The mother of nine was surrounded by her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. A farmer during her youth at her birthplace Tsolo, her seventh child, Nondyebo Majeke, said she was a strict parent who knew nearly every verse of the Bible. “She raised us according to the values of the church. All we did was farm and sell crops in our village in Tsolo,” said Majeke. Ngcikiza never worked for a salary, despite having a domestic science certificate from the St Cuthbert Mission College in Butterworth. Her husband, a teacher, also from Tsolo, died of natural causes in 1984. Ngcikiza has lived long enough to witness her 19 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren become successful. She cared for some of them in her house in Tsolo. However, the beloved elder is herself now under care at Kennersley Park senior citizens village in Bonza Bay. — mandilakhek@dispatch.co.za
