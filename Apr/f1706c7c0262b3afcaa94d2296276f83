Service delivery challenges and a shake-up of the Eastern Cape administration were key issues discussed in bilateral meetings between premier Phumulo Masualle and the province’s top five ANC leaders. ANC provincial secretary Lulama Ngcukayitobi told the Daily Dispatch yesterday that a “series of meetings” were held before Masualle left for China on Monday and were set to continue when he returned. Masualle, finance MEC Sakhumzi Somyo, agrarian reform MEC Mlibo Qoboshiyane and senior government officials left the country last weekend for a week-long trip to China.
