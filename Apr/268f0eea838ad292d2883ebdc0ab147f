Leaders of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church of South Africa have conferred the church’s prestigious John Calvin leadership award on ANC provincial chairman Oscar Mabuyane in Mthatha. EPCSA secretary Reverend Matshawandile Bacela said the event, held in Zimbane Valley in Mthatha on Saturday, honoured Mabuyane for the positive contribution he played in uniting the people of the Eastern Cape during his two terms as ANC provincial secretary. Mabuyane was first elected as the party’s provincial secretary at the watershed River Park conference in 2009. He served a second term after outclassing Michael Peter at an elective meeting in Port Elizabeth in June 2013. The Ngcobo-born ANC leader is the third recipient of the John Calvin leadership award, which is named after the founder of the church. The province’s former Independent Electoral Commission chairman, Reverend Bongani Finca, was the first person to receive the award. The church later honoured the late Epainette Nomaka Mbeki, the mother of former statesman Thabo Mbeki. Bacela said it was thanks to Mabuyane’s contribution that the ANC in the Eastern Cape has reclaimed its space in national politics. The Dispatch has reported on the central role the province played in creating a “united” ANC leadership at the Nasrec conference in December. “Today we pride ourselves with political stability because of the leadership provided by the former secretary, comrade Mabuyane, in the last two terms in the office,” said Bacela. Mabuyane was away on holiday when the church held the ceremony, and received the award on Wednesdaywhen he returned. ANC spokeswoman Judy Ngoloyi said the award was conferred as the Christian world celebrated the resurrection of Jesus Christ. She said this signified the church had always been the cornerstone of the ANC since its inception 106 years ago.
