Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s final resting place is a family gravesite in northern Johannesburg‚ where she will lie next to two great grandchildren. The one grave is that of baby Zenawe Zibuyile Mandela‚ who died in 2011 after being born three months prematurely to Zoleka Mandela and actor Sekoati Tsubane. The other is the grave of Zenani Mandela‚ who died aged 13 in a car accident after the 2010 Soccer World Cup kick-off concert‚ also at Orlando Stadium. After her death‚ the Zenani Campaign‚ led by her mother Zoleka Mandela and grandmother Zindzi Mandela‚ was launched to contribute to the United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety‚ which aims to improve the level of protection for children on roads mainly in developing countries. The Mandela family have a family estate block at the Fourways Memorial Park that can accommodate up to eight family members. The facility is a pristine‚ well-manicured private cemetery with guards and surveillance cameras. The cheapest gravesite costs R29‚000 and R300‚000 for a family estate.
