Well-known Eastern Cape football club boss Rodney “Mash” Mashaya, who has been languishing in jail for three weeks awaiting sentence for a theft committed in 2009, has to spend another 12 days in custody before learning his fate. The troubled civil engineer, who owns the East London-based ABC Motsepe provincial league outfit FC Buffalo, was arrested late last month after failing to comply with the conditions of his 2016 suspended sentence. Mashaya was found guilty in 2016 by Komani regional magistrate Onika van Papendorp of the 2009 theft of over R240000 from Ikhala TVET College in Komani – money he unlawfully spent after it had been deposited in the account of his company, Zezethu Engineers. According to the charge sheet, Mashaya’s company was appointed as a principal agent to manage a building contract worth R1.6-million and were paid R446360 for their services. The company was paid R1.2-million for the job – money Zezethu was meant to pay over to the construction company responsible for the building works. However, Mashaya’s company only transferred R714274 and illegally pocketed R485725. The court found that he and his business partner, Rodgers Klaas, later misappropriated this money. They later pleaded guilty to the theft, and were convicted in September 2016. The court sentenced them to five years in prison, but the sentence was suspended for five years on condition that they repaid the money within six months of being sentenced. Klaas paid his half but Mashaya failed to do so and was arrested for not complying with the suspension conditions. “We confirm that the inquiry into non-compliance of conditions of the suspended sentence was held and the case was postponed for judgment,” National Prosecuting Authority’s provincial spokesman Tsepo Ndwalaza said. Mashaya will appear in court to hear his fate on April 25. — asandan@dispatch.co.za
