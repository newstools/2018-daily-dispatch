AmaDlomo, AbaThembu traditional leadership and the community of Qunu where Nelson Mandela and his extended family are buried spoke of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, saying they still highly regard her as one of the royal wives of AmaDlomo despite the divorce with Madiba.
Senior AmaDlomo traditional leader, including Nkosi Mfundo Mtirara, Nkosi Zanomthetho Mtirara andNkosikazi Nokwanele Balizululu – who are closely related to Madiba – expressed their unwavering support to Madikilezela-Mandela during a memorial service held at the Methodist Church in Qunu today. The memorial service was organised by the ANC and ANC Women’s League in the OR Tambo regionin conjunction with the Qunu community and their leaders. ”Mam’uNobandla will forever remain the wife of Dalibhunga, the wife of AmaDlomo. It is foreign that when a woman is divorced in civil court is no more regarded as a wife of that family … that clan. “We all know that Mam’uNobandla. We were never at any point as ooMadiba, took a resolution to confirm that divorce and do what is known as ukukhethwa  kweenkomo. This happens if a woman is no longer regarded as a wife; her in-laws would select and take home some of the lobola cattle back. “This never happened in the case of Nobandla, said Mtirara.
