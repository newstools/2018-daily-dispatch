This is among damning findings of a judicial conduct tribunal’s investigation into his drunken 2007 car accident in Johannesburg‚ where he drove his Jaguar into the wall of a house. The judge was‚ according to the owner of the house‚ unable to stand due to his high levels of intoxication. The tribunal‚ in a finding dated April 12‚ has found that Motata was racist at the scene of the accident‚ and that this and his conduct on the scene “impinge on and are prejudicial to the impartiality and dignity of the courts”. The tribunal was also scathing in how Motata’s legal team handled his case against his drunk driving charges in court. But most damning was the tribunal’s view that Motata should be removed as a presiding officer. This is a developing story.
