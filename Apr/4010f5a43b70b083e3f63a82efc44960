An elderly man who was assaulted and abducted from his farm outside Addo spent the night tied up in a room of a home in Motherwell. He was dropped off at a petrol station on Sunday afternoon and managed to drive home and alert police. The traumatised man‚ 63‚ whom police have not named‚ was allegedly kidnapped by three men who assaulted him with an axe and demanded the keys to his safe on Saturday just before 7pm when he opened the security gate of his house to feed his horses. Police spokeswoman Captain Gerda Swart said the assailants had taken three firearms and other equipment from his home. “The suspects [then] forced [him] into his Isuzu bakkie and drove to a neighbouring farm‚” Swart said. There they forced the elderly man to open the neighbour’s house – which he was looking after while the family was out of town – and ransacked the house. The man was then tied up and kept in a room overnight. The Herald https://www.heraldlive.co.za/news/2018-04-16-abduction-ordeal-for-farmer-63-from-addo/
