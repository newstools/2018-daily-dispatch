Convicted racist Vicki Momberg has arrived in court after spending the past week in jail – and she’s sporting cornrows. Shocked grasps greeted Momberg’s arrival in courtroom 13 at the Randburg Magistrate’s Court in Johannesburg‚ where she was last week sentenced to an effective two years in jail for her racist rant against black police officials.
In a video that went viral on social media‚ Momberg was recorded using the k-word 48 times and complaining about the calibre of “k*****s” in Johannesburg. She pleaded not guilty to four charges of crimes injuria – defined as “a wilful injury to someone’s dignity‚ caused by the use of obscene or racially offensive language or gestures” – on the basis that she suffered from a form of temporary insanity. Momberg was convicted on all four charges and sentenced to an effective two years in jail. She’s appealing both her conviction and her sentence. That appeal application is expected to be postponed later this morning‚ as Momberg’s lawyer is unwell. Dan Roodt – who famously got into a skirmish at the Equality Court with Chester Missing over Steve Hofmeyr’s failed bid to get a protection order against the puppet – is also at court for Momberg’s court appearance. Twitter users are responding to Momberg’s new look with both humour and disapproval:     pic.twitter.com/HrgjEUYQl9 — Susie Carmichael (@Mwka__) April 4, 2018
