Clients of a Mdantsane money lender have accused the business of illegally withdrawing money from their bank and Sassa accounts. Amahle Madlodlo said her sister Nomandla’s three children were battling after R1600 of their social grant money was taken by Super Dragon Finance last month. “My sister took a loan of R600 in June and started paying back mid-year. She was told she should pay back R300 a month over three months but even though she finished paying the loan back, they continue to take money from her account. Last month they only left her with R90.” She said Dragon Finance told her they would fix the problem when she went to complain at the Mdantsane Mall offices last month. “For the full story get a copy of the Dispatch or subscribe to our e-Edition for the complete newspaper with jobs, classifieds, crosswords, TV schedules and back editions”.
