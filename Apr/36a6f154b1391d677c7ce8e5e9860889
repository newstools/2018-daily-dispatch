A perfect swing by amaXhosa King Mpendulo Zwelonke Sigcawu kicked off his inaugural Zwelonke Legacy Golf day fundraiser at the West Bank Golf course in East London early yesterday. The fundraiser is part of the King’s Development Legacy Project aimed at countering unemployment. About 40 businesspeople were welcomed to the club with songs and praises by children in Xhosa traditional attire. On the golf course, each company got to play a four-ball at a rate of R16000 per team. King Sigcawu’s spokesperson Chief Xolile Ndevu was elated by the response to his appeal. “The turnout exceeded our expectations,” said Ndevu. Businessman and radio legend Putco Mafani was a speaker and honoured guest at the event. Last month King Sigcawu told the Dispatch R1.2-million had already been raised for the project through donations from politicians, including Traditional Affairs Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize and DA leader Mmusi Maimane. BCM speaker Alfred Mtsi praised the king for his leadership qualities and said BCM was privileged to host such an event. The fundraiser coincides with the king’s 50th birthday celebrations. — mandilakhek@dispatch.co.za
