An actor rehearsing a fight-scene on a Drakensberg move set plunged to his death when he fell 40 metres into a river and was washed over a waterfall on Thursday. It is understood that the 39-year-old man, of Centurion, had fallen from a cliff at the Sterkspruit Waterfall near Monks Cowl in the southern Berg. His body was recovered from the pool below on Friday morning. He has not been named until his family have been notified. It is thought that the man had been rehearsing a fight scene with another actor had gotten too close to the edge of the river, lost his footing and had fallen in. Specialised divers from the Search and Rescue Unit as well as dog handlers were deployed to the mountainous region and, guided by the keen nose of a search dog, found the location of the manâ€™s body. Once it was pulled from the water, the body was hauled to the top of the gorge using a rope system. Police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said that police had registered an inquest docket.
