If you thought the struggle to make it to payday was giving you serious chest pains‚ think about poor Somizi who is quarter to being roasted by not only Ntsiki Mazwai‚ Gareth Cliff and Schalk Bezuidenhout‚ but now also Skhumba and singer Kurt Darren. Skhumba and Kurt were added to the list for Somizi’s Comedy Central roast‚ which airs next month. What are your thoughts on the new additions to the panel  @skhumba_official and @kurtdarren ??? All the mayhem with @showmaxonline  #RoastZA A post shared by  Comedy Central Africa (@comedycentralaf) on Apr 12, 2018 at 3:21am PDT  But Somizi ain’t running scared‚ especially by the thought of Kurt being his tormentor on the roast. You see‚ Somizi has his own little roast for Kurt. He shared his thoughts in a teaser for the show and we were all for it. So‚ come on‚ Somizi. Come with it. Somizi:

We are going to have lots of info‚ good stuff and juiciness. Some people will cry but it won’t be Somizi.” Somizi has said previously that he is not phased by the people who are going to roast him and was ready to give some spice back. “I have what it takes to handle the heat because I am thick skinned‚” he said. The show will be aired on May 7‚ DStv channel 122.
