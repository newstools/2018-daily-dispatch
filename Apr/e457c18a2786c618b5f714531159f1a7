Eastern Cape Home Affairs top brass presented an action plan to national DG Mkuseli Apleni in Pretoria yesterday aimed at alleviating the long queues in the department’s offices throughout the province. This follows Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba’s statement last Tuesday asking for a comprehensive report and strategy on managing the queue problem. The presentation was scheduled to take place last week but was delayed until yesterday. Eastern Cape manager Gcinile Mabulu told the Daily Dispatch their comprehensive action plan was now awaiting approval. “For the full story get a copy of the Dispatch or subscribe to our e-Edition for the complete newspaper with jobs, classifieds, crosswords, TV schedules and back editions”.
