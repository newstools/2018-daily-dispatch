Enoch Mgijima local municipality councillors are calling for a forensic investigation into the irregular expenditure of almost R4- million reported in the municipal public accounts committee (MPAC) section 52D report presented by the municipalityâ€™s MPAC chairwoman Marina Bennett in an ordinary council meeting last Thursday. Presenting the report, Bennett said R10 000 was approved by Donovan van Wyk on behalf of then-acting municipal manager Mziwoxolo Dingani and deposited into the account of a staff member of former executive mayor Lindiwe Gunuza-Nkwentsha in December, supposedly for fuel while Gunuza-Nkwentsha was attending a graduation ceremony in Johannesburg from December 13 to 15 last year.
