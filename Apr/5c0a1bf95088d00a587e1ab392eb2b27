ANC NEC member and Eastern Cape MEC for sport, recreation, arts and culture Pemmy Majodina says her fondest memories of the late anti-apartheid activist Winnie Madikizela-Mandela was her zero tolerance to sellouts.  According to Majodina, who was among youth activists who stayed with Madikizela-Mandela in the 80s, the late icon preached unity of purpose. She relayed one of the incidents wherein Mama Winnie displayed her intolerance towards selling out tendencies. “It was at the time when we stayed at her house, boys and girls young activists. This one evening we went to a memorial service of a comrade who had been killed,” said Majodina. “The security forces invaded the service and when other comrades were arrested, some of us ran away to her house. She was livid, she said ‘how dare you be cowards because that boy who was killed was younger than you! Go out and demand the release of those who have been arrested’. “She had love but she was very tough but that was to say when you are in battle, you must go together and never sellout because she was in essence regarding us as sellout for running away which she did not like.”
