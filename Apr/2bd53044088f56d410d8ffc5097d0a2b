With the Easter holiday officially over, the Buffalo City Metro recorded zero road accidents. However, the long weekend was mired by fatal road accidents on the province’s roads. In the early hours of yesterday, a vehicle carrying seven passengers overturned on the N2 outside Grahamstown heading in the direction of Port Elizabeth. Five passengers were killed instantly while a sixth passenger died on the way to hospital. A seventh passenger is still in hospital with severe injuries. A woman and child died on the N10 outside Cookhouse travelling towards Cradock yesterday when a bakkie hit a horse and lost control. The bakkie was towing a trailer which had a car on it. The woman and child were in the bakkie. A few days before Easter, the province had already recorded 21 deaths. Eastern Cape transport MEC Weziwe Tikana called for patience from motorists who were travelling back home. “We urge all motorists to ensure that their vehicles are fit for the road. Driver fitness is also critical in ensuring safety on the road.” The provincial transport department yesterday suspended 150 unroadworthy vehicles from using public roads. A total of 52 warrants of arrests were issued and eight motorists arrested for drunk driving while 43 stray animals were impounded during Easter roadblocks. The automated number plate recognition bus launched during last year’s festive season detected 157 offences and collected R67300 from fines. There were no deaths in the metro from the various recorded accidents. In Hanover location in BCM, an Opel Corsa bakkie carrying seven passengers lost control after a tyre burst, ending up in the bush and leaving four passengers injured and two seriously injured. In another accident, a driver driving a Ford double cab bakkie was seriously injured when the vehicle struck a robot in Alexandra Road. Transport Minister Blade Nzimande is expected to report the Easter weekend stats next week. — mandilakhek@dispatch.co.za
