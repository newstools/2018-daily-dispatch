WBO bantamweight world champion Zolani “Last Born” Tete has dedicated his upcoming title defence fight in Belfast to the late struggle icon Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Tete visited the Mandela home in Soweto today before jetting off to Europe to ready himself to the big fight billed for next Saturday. He told the Daily Dispatch that he was now filled with the fighting spirit of Mama Winnie and felt sorry for his opponent Omar Narvaez. “I feel sorry for that guy because he is going to be fighting two champions in one person, me and mama Winnie who’s fighting spirit lives in me and I vow to dedicate this to her selfless contribution to the liberation of our country,” said Tete. “Mama Winnie was a champion in her own right having fought also sorts of struggles during apartheid and emerged victorious mine is to emulate her hence I visited her home to get those blessings. “I’m ready to defend my title convincingly for Mama was never a coward and as such I’m now fired up so much so I wish this fight was tomorrow (Saturday) instead of next week.” Tete was accompanied by other Johannesburg-based boxing champions, MEC for sport; recreation, arts and culture Pemmy Majodina and Boxing SA chairman Peter Ngatane among others.
