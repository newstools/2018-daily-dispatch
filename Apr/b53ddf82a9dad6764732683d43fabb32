A BCM traffic vehicle collided with a VW Polo earlier today at the intersection of Oxford  and Stephenson streets causing a stretch of the busy road to be temporarily closed.  The collision saw the traffic vehicle flipping onto its roof. Bathandwa Diamond, the BCM spokeswoman, said: “When the incident happened, Officer Thozama Maholwana was reacting to an emergency situation where one of her fellow traffic officer’s life was in danger. “Maholwana was responding from the bottom of Oxford Street, in a south to north direction, towards Kimberley Road. “Two other vehicles that were going down Oxford Street towards North Street were collided into by the traffic vehicle after it had overturned. “At the scene, Maholwana was attended to by Red Alert emergency services with moderate injuries and taken to St Dominic’s Hospital and she has since been discharged. All the other drivers sustained slight injuries.”
