Despite Police Minister Bheki Cele last week imposing a ban which prohibits taxis from operating along the R61 and N2 routes in Mthatha, some taxis were seen picking up hitchhikers along the two roads this morning. But Eastern Cape provincial transport spokeswoman Khuselwa Rantjie said whoever was caught doing that would be fined a sum of R4000 or face six months imprisonment. “They are not supposed to do that [operate on the routes],” she said. “A [government] gazette with the conditions [as announced by the Minister] was published on Thursday last week.The taxi associations involved have seven days to oppose it.” The Daily Dispatch has previously reported that Cele had announced the indefinite closure of the R61 between Mthatha and Port St Johns, the N2 between Mthatha and Tsolo and the R396 between Tsolo and Maclear. This was aimed at curbing ongoing taxi violence which has claimed more than 60 lives since 2016. The government meanwhile had promised to provide an alternative for commuters but Rantjie confirmed this morning that the state has not been able to secure a bus service to offer alternative transportation for commuters. “We are working around the clock to secure a provider,” she added.
