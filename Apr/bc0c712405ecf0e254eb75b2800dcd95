Taxi drivers found operating on routes along the R61, N2 and R396 roads, which were closed to taxis by Police Minister Bheki Cele last week, could be fined or even imprisoned. Eastern Cape transport authorities issued the warning yesterday after some taxis were seen picking up hitchhikers on the routes despite the prohibition. Provincial transport spokes- woman Khuselwa Rantjie said if caught, drivers would be liable for a R4000 fine or face six months’ imprisonment. “A [government] gazette with the conditions [as announced by the minister] was published on Thursday last week,” said Rantjie yesterday. “The taxi associations involved have seven days to oppose it.” As part of measures to curb the ongoing taxi violence, which has claimed more than 60 lives since 2016, Cele announced the indefinite closure of the R61 between Mthatha and Port St Johns, the N2 between Mthatha and Tsolo and the R396 route between Tsolo and Maclear. Hundreds of commuters have been left stranded following the announcement last week despite government promising to provide them with an alternative. However, by yesterday, there was still no backup plan in place. Yesterday, a few hitchhikers along the N2 and the R61 were seen getting into taxis. Rantjie confirmed that her department had been granted approval by treasury to source buses to service the closed routes but they had been unable to secure one thus far. Border Alliance Taxi Association (Bata) president Vuyani Mshiywa, who last week applauded the closure of the routes, yesterday labelled the taxi drivers as chance-takers. Rantjie said they were waiting for the two warring associations, Bata and Uncedo Taxi Service Association, to come up with a solution to end the incessant violence. “The matter is in their hands. As the minister has said, the lives of innocent people were at risk, hence the decision to close the routes last week,” she said. — sikhon@dispatch.co.za
