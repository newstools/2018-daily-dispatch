A large ANC flag flew outside the house of the late struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in Soweto on Thursday morning as African National Congress national executive committee members arrived to offer their condolences.  A truck bedecked with ANC colours‚ serving as a stage‚ was parked outside the house and played struggle songs as mourners moved to the rhythm of the music from loud speakers on the platform. A throng of people sang struggle songs as NEC members filed inside Madikizela-Mandela’s house to pay their last respects. One of the NEC members‚ Minister of Small Business Development Lindiwe Zulu‚ said the NEC was visiting the house to pay its last respects to the family of Madikizela-Mandela. “Up to her last breath‚ she remained a member of the ANC.
