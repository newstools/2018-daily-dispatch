Eighteen modelling hopefuls will be strutting their stuff for the Miss Wild Coast title later this year. The top 18 semifinalists were announced late last month and will each become an ambassador of a coastal area and market it across the province and outside. Event organiser Buhle Tonise said Miss Wild Coast was not like any other beauty pageant in that it was “more a women empowerment programme that is part of a bigger plan to market the Wild Coast to the domestic and international tourism market and thereby create jobs and stimulate the rural economy”. The top 18 semifinalists are: Akhanya Qothola from Butterworth; Akhona Mkile from Elliotdale; Asaphiwe Ngqandu from Komga; Anathi Sohopu from Mooiplaas; Bathabile Mpopoma from Mthatha; Joleen Fathula from East London; Mihlali Seyisi from East London; Namhla Fambaza from Mount Frere; Nokuthula Bangaza from Mthatha; Patience Ngho from Engcobo; Sihle Mgidi from Ngqamakhwe; Simamkele Mjali from Libode; Sinovuyo Mtshalu from Mthatha; Siyamthanda Guzana from King William’s Town; Yeyethu Rataza from Whittlesea; Yolanda Pikashe from East London, Ziyanda Mgwebi from Bizana and Zizo Sifolo from Kei Mouth. Tonise said each contestant would adopt a beautiful place along the Wild Coast and will receive training on how to use various instruments to market it. “As they do this they will learn valuable skills in how to use media for personal branding and career development rather,” she said. Miss Wild Coast is under the banner of Shevolution Africa, a women and youth empowerment non-profit company. Tonise said they would soon launch a public voting system that would ultimately produce the top 12 finalists. The top 12 will be revealed in May and the finale will be held in September.
